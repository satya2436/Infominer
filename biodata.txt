preface change is the watchword times the pace as less time is available for master s and doctoral at the same time schooling is as demanding as ever in the form in scientific theory and practice we hope that this textbook will make academic life easier for graduate the history book in in a norwegian national for medical faculty leading to which in part for a compulsory course for all enrolled in doctoral at medical the course a broad range and now been eral times its curriculum the basis book which was first pub in norwegian by this edition in english is a revised and expanded version norwegian edition there are several for the broad range included in the and in this book doctoral should qualify the candidate for research as well as for other professional scientific insight not least in the research process in both depth and breadth doctoral at medical have a variety that may include undergraduate in medicine the natural the social or nursing many of these may have only narrow scientific so that even after finishing their graduate they will barely be able to work with or be advised by other than those within their own narrow it is essential that leading to a doctoral degree include schooling in general scientific research regardless specific discipline p page xi entire have been written on each in the of this book some are and listed under further reading at the end but in our experience few doctoral read professional mostly because the time for is so short that extracurricular reading is limited to at best hence we believe that there is a need for a book such as this one comprehensive yet succinct this book is intended for with various professional communication and research are increasingly important so in any one scientific community should be familiar with and respect the scientific simply put this book the curriculum for doctoral in medicine but is also intended for in the biological and we hope that it can give the reader a broad scientific perspective we believe that everyone in the medical and should know a little about all the book and that all should have knowledge relative to their we have tried to make the material easily accessible for a broad group in part through many for instance chapter on statistical data analyses we have made the data we have used accessible at along with these data we have included some statistical tables we chose the statistical program package for other application could have equally well we are grateful to kristian for and the data tables and used in chapter we extend our thanks

living creature and as a social and a spiritual person correspondingly philosophy the philosophical and it is an enormous field covering such as mathematics computer and logic the formal social the natural and also such as history against the backdrop sweep field this chapter a phil salient to research in the medical and biological consequently discussion is limited to the natural section and the social section the formal such as logic and mathematics are not philosophy of the natural what do we mean when we say that smoking is the cause cancer what as a scientific explanation what is science about e g what is a cell how do we obtain scientific evidence how can we reduce uncertainty what are the p page these are only a few in philosophy natural which are to be in this chapter traditional philosophy of science the traditional philosophy d to put forth logical analyses and in particular the logical analysis syntax in the following the principal traditional concerning reason method evidence and the object the world are the glue of the world causation a pivotal task is to find the such as disease however what is the implication that something is the cause disease according to robert koch who was the prize in physiology or medicine for finding the tuberculosis bacillus in a parasite can be seen as the cause disease can be shown that the presence parasite is not a random accident such random may be by satisfying the koch the organism must be found in all suffering from the disease but not in healthy the organism must be isolated from a diseased animal and grown in pure culture the cultured organism should cause disease when into a healthy animal the organism must be from the experimentally infected animal as clear to koch these criteria are elusive are con to be general criteria for something to be a cause in the causation is unlikely that overly stringent criteria for causation minimize the chance the british medical statistician austin bradford hill outlined tenable minimal germane to a causal relationship between two nine criteria were as a way to chapter p page determine the causal link between a specific factor such as cigarette smoking and a disease such as emphysema or lung cancer strength the the association the less likely the relation ship is due to chance or a confounding variable consistency association the association been by different people in different and times similar to the replication specificity association is limited to specific people and ease and is no association between the exposure and other of dying then the relationship causation temporality the exposure must precede the outcome by a period consistent with any biological mechanism biological gradient there is a gradient associated with the degree of exposure dose response relationship biological plausibility there is a known or mechanism by which the exposure might reasonably alter the risk the disease coherence the data should not conflict with known about the natural history and biology disease experiment the support for causation may be through con clinical intervention animal analogy in some it is fair to judge cause effect by analogy with the effects and rubella before us it is fair to accept slighter but similar evidence with another drug or another viral disease in pregnancy hence with regard to causality these criteria are less pretentious than the koch nonetheless there are many where we might refer to the cause of the disease but where the criteria do not apply however the bradford hill admit that causation in the is far from deterministic as in the koch and that it is an amalgam general criteria however studied in the are not deterministic what then are they that is what is the true nature causation with which we deal in the deterministic version we know both and the sufficient for an event the koch require that there are no without the and there are no philosophy of p page without the manifestation as koch when he discovered the asymptomatic the requirement necessary and sufficient for causation is overly rigorous whenever there is a necessary but condition for an event we do not say that it the event for example an arm is a necessary condition for an inflammation but an arm is not said to be the cause inflammation in this case multiple are for something happen ing but no one alone is sufficient there may be many necessary for an event that are not considered nevertheless necessary are germane to causation as without them the event will not occur hence are relevant through their absence we can eliminate tuberculosis by one necessary mycobacterium tuberculosis it is also important to notice that necessity can mean two different necessity can mean that is nothing else than a could have in b e g the modification gene is the only thing that in s disease but necessity can also mean non redundancy that is when many can result in b but one is a in combination with r and s see figure in this case a is non redundant a virus infection is a non redundant condition for a cold as there are many other resulting in a cold but when these are absent and you do not have a virus infection you will not have a cold under those the virus infection is a necessary for a cold chapter and r and redundant figure two of necessity a is an irreplaceable condition for b only other than a could have in b the situation when there is a sufficient but not necessary condition for example when a person cancer after being exposed to radiation known to be sort and strength that in cancer we tend to say that the p page radiation the cancer the cancer could have been by other sufficient in the absence radiation nevertheless sufficient condition is present we know that the event the effect will occur hence sufficient for an event are said to be its in to necessary they work through their presence another situation is when there are two that individually are insufficient for a certain event but which together make an event occur for exam alone being stung by a bee or being hypersensitive to bee venom does not cause an anaphylactic reaction however in certain acting jointly both may be sufficient and necessary for an anaphylactic reaction so both are said to cause the event in short each is an insufficient but necessary part sufficient and necessary condition for the event although we seldom find single that are both sufficient and necessary for in the we more often find where multiple together are sufficient and necessary consider the scenario when a person a lethal dose of poison no anti dote is taken the stomach is not and the person what is the cause of death does the person die because poison is because no antidote is taken or because the stomach is not poison alone is not sufficient as many people drink poison without death because their are however drinking the poison is part concert that are jointly sufficient to cause death moreover given this set and not another set sufficient for death the poison was non redundant do not occur in such when poison is not drunk accordingly drinking poison is an insufficient and non redundant part unnecessary but sufficient condition for death this is an condition it can be that many in as causal satisfy hence causation is given by the event are both sufficient and necessary are jointly sufficient and necessary or are then one could argue that they are however what about smoking and lung cancer is ing an condition for lung cancer the fact that not all develop lung cancer and not all people with lung cancer have been ers however it a concert for which lung cancer when but not when non are subjected to them philosophy of p page common to causation in and necessary is that they hinge on scientific determinism that is that complex can be reduced to simple deterministic and therefore in be in the case being an condition for lung cancer all the are not known hence we will have to assume the existence of hidden in order to retain determinism the unidentified con as well as the difficulty in explaining dose response relationship sufficient component sufficient condition insufficient but necessary part sufficient and necessary condition and rather than satisfying an condition we observe that develop lung cancer at higher than do non this leads us to believe that the probability cancer among is the causal link this a probabilistic approach to causation the central idea in probabilistic is that raise the probability effects despite their plausibility probabilistic to causation are with regard to how much a probability must be raised in order to become a cause we say that aspirin s syndrome in and that certain cause toxic shock syndrome though the are low accordingly it becomes difficult to differentiate between causation and non causal moreover some are uncomfortable with the propensity to abandon determinism are not determined as although there may have been probabilistic for them this may frustrate the aim causality certain disease and symptom relief health in other event is not determined to have then nothing can be part sufficient condition for it hence some would prefer to say that smoking is an condition for lung cancer although we do not yet know the concert sufficient for its occurrence another approach that the presence or absence cause a difference this is expressed by a on the con between one outcome the effect given certain the cause and another outcome given alternative c e same condition except c would result in a condition different from e when all other are equal for example had taken two instead a glass an hour ago my headache would now be gone a chapter p page conception is considered to be more precise with respect to what dis causation from mere association than the probabilistic approach while it to hidden deterministic can also be probabilistic had taken two instead a glass an hour ago i would be much less likely to have a headache now however in practice it is not easy to satisfy the condition the same individual cannot be in exactly the same situation as both a smoker and a non smoker it is important to notice that the different are not mutually exclusive for example a probabilistic approach does not exclude altogether a sufficient cause is one that the probability of its effect to one a where a factor all the differ is equal to a necessary condition see box and table philosophy of some criteria for causation sufficient for an event insufficient but necessary part sufficient and necessary condition for an event insufficient and non redundant part unnecessary but sufficient condition for an event raised probability for an event non deterministic the condition cause a difference with respect to the with to determinism sufficient condition probabilistic insufficient but necessary part sufficient and necessary condition does not occur e does not occur sine qua non p page might the be by to might there be an imperative to find significant in the scientific explanation from the time have that a distinction could be made between two knowledge roughly knowledge why it is one matter to know infarction is associated with certain angina it is a different matter to know why this is so knowledge former type is descriptive knowledge latter type is explanatory and it is explanatory knowledge that scientific understanding world salmon how then do we explain the phenomena studied in the for example how do we explain the change in cell growth in a medium when its temperature what criteria do we have for something to be acceptable as a scientific explanation the standard answer to such as these is that we explain something by showing how we could expect it to happen according to the nomic the cell growth is by the that govern cell growth and the initial the type the humidity and the pressure accordingly a singular event is if a description of the event from law like and a set when a phenomenon is by it from or law like state the sequence is said to follow a deductive nomological model that turns an explanation into an argument where law like state and initial are the deductive argument deductive nomological model chapter premise initial humidity light temperature premise universal law s cell growth conclusion event or fact to be greater growth due to temperature p page in other we explain a phenomenon by it in a law for this reason is often to as the covering law model one reason for the prominent position is its close relation to prediction a deductive nomological explanation event to a prediction occurrence however one is that for symmetry for instance certain growth medium for temperature humid light can be by the growth rate in this medium given the same we like to think that there is an asymmetry between cause and effect that is what is considered to be a cause leads to an effect and not the other way round moreover can provide only when subsume under deterministic then there are innumerable phenomena that cannot be for instance we tend to say that lung cancer can be by smoking despite there being no strict law which will develop lung cancer the answer to this objection is straightforward and deterministic with probabilistic this the deductive statistical model which the form deductive statistical model philosophy of science premise initial sinusitis premise statistical probably leads to recovery conclusion event or fact to people taking will recover be is a version that by deduction from more general instead however cannot explain singular such as mr from a sinusitis after taking can only explain why people taking will recover in general in order to explain singular in one may refer to the inductive statistical model ism nation hence ism can explain likely inductively from statistical p page inductive statistical model premise initial sinusitis and premise probability r the probability in given such r induction event or fact to be will recover table the traditional and ism common to all the is that are deductive or inductive and that they are based on initial and on law like state either deterministic or statist nomic expectancy the standard form such argument is premise initial premise law like implication event or fact to be most in the appear to fall under these chapter table according to salmon universal statistical however these incur many one is that with true are not necessarily explanatory for instance birth control and is a man initial and man who birth control becomes pregnant law it leads deductively to the conclusion that will not become pregnant according to taking birth control then why cannot become pregnant but it is intuitively wrong because the are explanatorily irrelevant as already symmetry for example us to use plane geometry and the elevation sun to find the height flagpole from the length shadow as well as predict the length shadow from the height flagpole however as the length shadow clearly does not p page explain the height flagpole does not present a set for scientific explanation these with regard to relevance and symmetry have made some argue that should be based on causation to explain is to attribute a cause according to such a causal model one must follow specific for at an explanation par phenomenon or event compile a list relevant analyse the list by a variety create causal statistical test the to determine w is best by the evidence however these revert to some moreover although it is intuitively correct that to explain a phenomenon is to find its cause it is not necessarily so indeed david hume that regular association between cause and effect hume s conception of causation as nothing to an explanation one event another accordingly bertrand russel that causation is a relic from a bygone age surviving like the monarchy only because it is erroneously sup to do no harm russell p explanation in would enhance our ability to predict but not to understand the phenomena accordingly explanation more than to a cause it understanding and thus one could argue it must include the hence and ism the principal relevant to the are but three many for scientific explanation of inference the tend to employ three first set forth in by charles sanders pierce de duction induction and abduction deduction inference from general to particular via logic l people with type insulin dependent diabetes are known to have in pancreatic insulin production rule and mr d type diabetes case then mr d in pancreatic insulin production conclusion philosophy of p page induction is inference to a general rule from particular if all people with in pancreatic insulin production have the diabetes and the people are all from the general lation that is not selected with other causing the we conclude that all people with in pancreatic insulin production have the diabetes abduction the best explanation when we make a certain observation case we find a hypothesis rule that it possible to deduce the con d in pancreatic insulin production and all people with type diabetes have in pancreatic insulin then mr d type diabetes the crucial aspect is ether the hold while both and inference are knowledge ampliative inference in induction we infer from some c to the general rule and in there could be other that could explain what we observe that is other may be even better table the between these three chapter table deduction all are rule all in this urn are red all are case all in this particular sample are taken from this urn all are conclusion all in this particular sample are red induction all are conclusion all in this particular sample are red all are case all in this particular sample are taken from this urn all are rule all in this urn are red abduction all are rule all in this urn are red all are conclusion all in this particular sample are red all are case all in this particular sample are taken from this urn p page what science is are about this world and its phenomena however what world many find this question odd even irrelevant we deal with and the effects and it is clear to most that exist and that they more or less correspond to our however in history there are innumerable where reality such as phlogiston by the german physician and alchemist johann joachim becher ether and cadaver poison have been by new and new how can we be sure that the world is as our portray it and how can we explain that our change scientific hold that successful scientific research characteristically knowledge phenomena world and that this knowledge is largely independent furthermore hold that such knowledge is possible even in in which the relevant phenomena are not observable according to scientific realism you have good reason to believe what is written in a good contemporary medical textbook because the had solid scientific evidence for the approximate truth put forth about the existence and and and the moreover you have good reason to think that such phenomena have the to them in the textbook independent in medicine consequently scientific realism can be as the own philosophy on the other hand scientific antirealism that the knowledge world is not independent mode a scientific might say that do not exist about them are for thinking they explain phenomena such as the light beam surgical laser of course the energy from a laser as well as the coagulation but the are not to exist the point is that there is no way we can know whether the world is independent and one may distinguish several realism a weak notion realism that there a real world independent scrutiny without advancing any claim about what it is like a notion that not only does the world exist independently scientific enquiry but the world a structure which is independent enquiry philosophy of p page an even notion realism that certain in scientific such as and exist independently of and their enquiry world accordingly the scientific realist that when phenomena such as and are correctly by they actually exist realism is common sense and certainly common science as we do not doubt that the phenomena we study exist and however how can this intuition be this is where the philosophical start three justifying scientific realism may be advanced transcendental high level empirical and interventionist the transcendental argument what the world must be like to make science possible its first premise is that science its second premise is that there must be a structured world independent knowledge there is no way that science could exist considering its complexity and extent science did not exist hence the argument rea sons from what we believe to the for its existence even when science is seen as a social activity how could this activity exist without the precondition that the world actually that is science is intelligible as an activity only assume realism however one premise argument is that science our knowledge world and but how do we know this furthermore how can we reason from what we believe to exist to the existence the answer is that we do so through thought we could not think effects microbiological with out the existence from this we argue that the existence is a necessary condition for the microbiological but what that the reason that we cannot think microbiological without the existence is not due to the imagination the high level empirical argument that scientific are mately true because they best elucidate the success the best way to explain progress and success in science is to observe that the terminology of mature typically to real in the world and the of mature typically are approximately true however this is an argument where we argue from the conclusion science chapter p page success and the rule is about real then it success to the case science is about real are knowledge expanding and there may be other that are better but that are yet not available to us the interventionist argument that we can have well grounded about what we can do hacking we can use inter to test whether the scientific exist induced intervention does not work it does not exist but can spray them then they are real hence you can test whether something is real one problem with the interventionist argument is that it is not robust with respect to explanation test whether are real by them with red paint you may conclude that are not real however how do you know that this is the right method to show that are real could it not be that red paint does not adhere to whereas yellow paint does scientific realism which most find common sense is exasperatingly difficult to justify one could dismiss the whole question by that observable are what and whether be it pho or arthritis are real does not matter however at certain a scientist may reflect upon the nature ontology studied scientific rationality rationalism is the position that reason precedence to other ways knowledge traditionally rationalism is with empiricism that true knowledge world can be through sensory experience in antiquity rationalism and empiricism to two the former primarily on theoretical knowledge concealed of the human body the latter on direct clinical experience one might argue that the demarcation between rationalism and empiricism remains relevant in clinical practice but not in science there are many of in which established on rationalistic ground such as ligation of as a treatment for angina have been revealed by empirical to be without effect beyond placebo correspondingly established induced from experience have been revealed to be without philosophy of p page effect or even to be detrimental however modern tend to rely on rationality as well as on experience in their work hypotheses may be gen on rational grounds the substance s should have the effect e because it the x y and z and are tested such as in ani mal or in clinical nevertheless the enduring rationalism empiricism debate still relevant in the because there are to scientific methodology there may be ethical such as reluctance to use placebo surgery which empirical research or there may be lack with respect to limiting a rationalistic approach such as when we wish to test a substance that to have promise in a ed effect but for which we lack the knowledge it should work theory testing the author most prominent hippocratic the art cine three to medical treatment and research the effects may be due to luck or accident and not intervention the effect even is no intervention and the effect may not be despite intervention in the terminology we are faced with the that the intervention is not a necessary condition and not a sufficient condition for the effect and that there may be a probabilistic between intervention and effect or there may be other unknown effect today almost three millennia later we still struggle with the same kind how can we be certain that our and hypothesis world are true given the large variety the standard answer to the question is to put the hypothesis to an empirical test according to the hypothetical method the hypothetical deductive method is the scientific method hypotheses by making observable then observing the turn out as the hypothesis is confirmed and the hypothesis is or the hypothetical deductive model are state a clear and experimentally testable hypothesis deduce the empirical hypothesis chapter p page perform empirical in order to compare their with the empirical concur with the one can conclude that the hypothesis is confirmed otherwise it is according to the traditional interpretation model hypotheses can be con and scientific knowledge is through the verification more hypotheses table philosophy of simplified comparison between the structure and falsification is better than b b is better than a empirical is better than b we must is better than a we must that a better observe that b better than b in the empirical than a in the empirical and we observe that where we observe where is used obtain better a is used obtain better than b experiment the the experiment the hypothesis hypothesis and support to the alternative hypothesis a is better than b logical then q then q confirming the antecedent not p however as karl popper this approach cannot avoid the above first the verification hypothesis induction which is not warranted secondly the logical form model is not sound moreover popper was critical early twentieth century lack criteria for scientific truth and corresponding trend to use p page scientific authority to decide what was true which made it difficult to science from other social po s radical turn was to avoid explicit authoritative criteria for truth and to provide stringent for testing hypotheses furthermore he broke with the ideal determination truth and provided a scientific knowledge base hypotheses scientific knowledge through enlarging the graveyard of hypotheses the method rather than that all truth provisional conjectural and hypothetical according to popper cannot determine theory only delimit it cannot be from only show which are false not which are true see box chapter box popper on the success of refutation have often been as the failure or at least theory it should be that this is an error every refutation should be as a great success not merely a success scientist who the theory but also scientist who the theory and who thus in the first instance if only indirectly the experiment even new theory such as the theory and slater should meet an early death it should not be forgotten rather its beauty should be and history should record our gratitude to it for to us new and perhaps still unexplained experimental and with them new and for the it thus to the progress during its successful but short life popper method in empirical the approach see figure is used almost daily often without a thought the control experiment is a typical example can a possible effect or an absent effect have a trivial explanation might over time p page or in produce effects or might the have to respond at all control are included to rule out such trivial in clinical research may be strongly by the treatment situation and a placebo may cause an effect so a placebo group is included to rule out falsify this hypothesis correspondingly are double blind to falsify the hypothesis that the effect treatment is due to the experimenter correspondingly statistical are to falsify the hypothesis that a result is owing to selection as they include assess ment between are random this is done by setting up the contention null hypothesis h that there is no difference between the and thereafter the probability for its being true if that probability is very small the null hypothesis is which the principal hypothesis that there is a real not random difference a hypothesis must have testable is to have scientific value is not testable and thus not falsifiable then it is not science as popper the lack often scientific progress because limited what can be enquiry therefore often a new more powerful method science ahead s new research open up outstanding include development chain reaction in molecular biology by a prize in and the development patch clamp in by erwin and bert by a prize in the development is closely associated with the development of and the many hypotheses can be shown to be too imprecise and ambiguous to be and consequently cannot be as philosophy of the method p page popper formally there should be two alternative hypotheses that ally exclude each other then a decisive experiment should be done to distinguish between them hypothesis is this may lead to the development hypotheses which in turn can be tested moreover a hypothesis should have the power to explain it should relate to generally accepted theoretical basis field there must be good grounds to reject established such as an accepted law a theory that on the grounds may be by its who that it forward ad hypotheses whenever so indicate it is advisable to modify a hypothesis in fact that is part scientific process however an ad hypothesis from a hypothesis in that it is not testable and often is more complicated and consequently usually rathe r than scientific development although falsification become common ground in empirical research its and are not always according to popper a theory or hypothesis should be bold and far ranging its empirical con tent should be high that is it should have great predictable power furthermore the hypothesis should be testable with a radical test from the test support the hypothesis it is but not it is regardless influential popper s approach been and still is in research in the been severely four to it are frequently first when we falsify we do not test their prospective robustness we only test them on past evidence secondly a severe test is one that is surprising and unlikely on present evidence however to set up a test that is unlikely we base our knowledge on what is likely and in so doing we rely on induction accordingly really induction there is no reason to act on or hypotheses because doing so would be induction thirdly when we falsify a theory it is on however observational should also be fallible and hence the theory may be erroneous observational are not true chapter p page fourthly popper s method can lead to falsification and fruitful with high empirical content such as due to in the test procedure in practice we do not falsify a potentially fruitful theory on the basis one observation that is a theory that is not is not necessarily we design new and ad hypotheses to investigate or explain the observation hence in practice we falsify not single but rather or aim of science reducing uncertainty the primary aim is to increase knowledge in order to explain under stand and intervene we need scientific knowledge to reduce our uncertainty it is convenient to differentiate among four of uncertainty risk ignorance and indeterminacy table philosophy of the known ambiguity unknown risk is when the system behaviour is basically well known and the of different can be defined and by structured analysis and it is a task to find the given or intervention and its probability for example the outcome with respect to survival rate with respect to cardiovascular disease when lactic for with type non insulin dependent diabetes uncertainty is by knowledge important system but not probability we may know the major certain intervention but we do not know their respective there may be many such as uncertainty in reasoning how to a single case with to general there may also be uncertainty in theory such as when all in a certain field are not known in detail or because causation moreover may be and it can be difficult to know and understand all in the case the main task is to provide the probability p page ignorance is the case when we know neither the nor their the aim is to find both however this is difficult as we do not know what we do not know even though we would be able to reduce all ignorance to uncertainty and all to risk we still might be subject to indeterminacy it is not always a question due to imprecision which is assumed to be nar rowed by more research but also a question we according to different or criteria when we myocardial infarction accord ing to a set criteria we will have a different perspective than it according to the level in the blood likewise investigate pain in activity or according to a visual analogue scale vas the risk uncertainty and ignorance may differ may not be subject to from given initial owing to imprecise classification the empirical turn in philosophy of science although many within traditional philosophy as above have been and progress been made interesting and fruitful have been through empirical and intimate empirical have revealed characteristic social in particular the and have been shown to be basically similar to the and in society the traditional philosophy been theoretical and pally on the that is knowledge and its conceptual the are empirical and focus on the social of science and its interaction with material a seminal and famous study of scientific activity that knowledge is not accumulative and that science does not develop in a linear manner instead it in an abrupt way scientific with quiescent inspired by s paradigmatic conception progress and by s on rule following and language a series the sociology sok move ment the key issue is to show that science is a social activity that chapter p page social in the same manner as do other in society the question of how are in the world cannot be without the question the social group be it or cannot be a role in our world independent and meaning hence while the traditional philosophy had procedural criteria of science from non science such as popper s criteria sok social criteria whereas the normative aim science was to free science from power inherent in the social among and in society sok to disclose power within the scientific society and to emancipate in many the key issue in the classical philosophy been the relationship between scientific and nature in sok the focus is on the relationship between theory and culture in what way do scientific reflect social instead world nevertheless what to be similar in both the traditional philosophy and sok is the focus on epistemological in both the key question is what scientific represent in the first case they represent in nature in the second they represent social later have tried to avoid this representational pattern their empirical have not only the relationship between and the social and in science but the scientific process itself its material how do behave and how do they produce the this may be a processual approach pa according to which science is the change making new and ing and what the social process is an interaction material and where lead to and generation when species bac were found to be associated with gastric and peptic scientific debate on the bases and on empirical work confirmed that h is a key factor there is no question about what the theory either nature or but rather it is a question between different scientific with regard to what will be considered to compromise hence according to philosophy of p page the pa the are not the relationship between theory and nature culture epistemological and representational but what regard and treat as real ontological and processual philosophy of the social a significant part overall spectrum mat that principally are not biological should we wish to find why do not take why wrong are given in or why it is difficult to obtain fully informed consent for or treatment we cannot search for in human biological research but instead must turn to the of the social so it is essential to know the ways in which the social and the biological differ so that we do not erroneously use the area to judge another in the social many different are used and there are various so the discussion here a and does not cover the broad scope and interpretation understanding and explanation the social differ from the biological in two they entail greater that often enter into in many a result is an understanding not an explanation explanation and principal goal in the biological is to elicit of phenomena studied one might for instance seek the cause particular mani disease some in the social also seek causal phenomena but many seek instead an understanding understanding is a form chapter p page that us to know why a person or a group in a par way why and how they experience a specific situation how they them understand their way and so on we attain understanding through interpretation the distinction between explanation and understanding was first expressed by the german philosopher psychologist and educator wilhelm who that these two ways the world were characteristic of the natural and the human respectively however the distinction between ex planation and understanding is not as distinct as many believe many social include causal explanation and non causal understanding interpretation all content bearing and can be people express themselves not just in speech writing and but also in architecture garden design clothing if for example we enquire into where and why for psychologically ill were built we will find that the history vary ing illness the architecture asylum is con tent bearing however here we will focus on the interpretation and other linguistic as it is germane in the discussion theory often hermeneutics interpretation may have many but in general we seek to fathom the content content bearing material the various are based on nature and how it should be is there content in a statement itself in the person making the statement in the social structure in which the statement is made these are germane when the validity of the social but are importance here in the general discussion of interpretation the question one a interpretation text is old all written have for the content for example in christian theology biblical exegesis interpretation philosophy of p page in modern times interest arose in the interpretation first as part and historical research and then as a part in the social the goal various hermeneutic me that have been is to arrive at an understanding that can be as a valid understanding that is it is an understanding that can be and rationally as popper pointed out the enter into all and thereby into all we lack direct access to the world as it is through our we always view the world through a theoretical filter and all are theoretically loaded for example when we say that the sun we reflect the influence old geocentric world view in which the sun circled the earth and the description that a pathologist histological seen by microscope is to a large ex tent an interpretation based on of inflammation the hermeneutic circle understanding horizon and double hermeneutics the hermeneutic interpretation text on individual as well as on the understanding individual part related to the whole neither an individual part nor the whole text may be without reference to each other so interpretation is circular the hermeneutic circle in principle this circle cannot lead to certain closure as we will never know whether a analysis text may change our interpretation the problem valid intersubjective interpretation long been and l is and optimistic interpretation speak hermeneutic spiral that that interpretation better and better at the pragmatic level the problem hermeneutic circle is less worthy as agreement on the meaning text usually can be more easily the concrete interpretation is also by the interpreter s horizon of understanding a concept from the principal work of german philosopher hans that before i have begun a conversation with another person or begun to interpret a text i already have bias about them based on my horizon a collective chapter p page term for my world view my horizon up throughout my life and my understanding the that lar and hold for me and so on for a resident the word city financial while for people elsewhere it simply an urban concentration two people engaging in a conversation may believe that they have understood each other without actually done so full understanding is possible only when two people have acquired each other s fused hence there may be a prob as in in the social which often are too short for the interviewer to understand the interviewee s horizon consequently a vital part interview an effort to find out how the interviewee and and in the area being furthermore english sociologist anthony pointed out that within the social research a double hermeneutics in reality the social research of their own and arise through con that they have acquired from the social such as the marxist concept or the incest taboo hence there is a plex interaction between the researcher and the interviewee which is why an additional level often may be to focus on how an interviewee s self image is affected by the science consequently an interviewee may be misunderstood interviewer does not take such into account power ideology and our and dee are by in addition to our the ger pointed out that power ideology and play leading usually we are not neutral or objective but interpret according to our power our ideology and the we wish to further in view ideology is not restricted to political ideology an ideology is simply a set that further the particular group in philosophy of p page society for example the assertion that an extensive hospital system is essential in is an ideology that in addition to the the and other a difficulty with is that they are often concealed as we neither are aware that we have them nor know where they came from so behind our they influence our and our consequently that the principal task for the critical social is to identify so we may be freed from them validity in the above we have widely that an interpret and the understanding that we attain through interpretation can never be a final truth concerning the meaning particular statement unless the state ment is extremely simple so we are obliged to ask how we can judge the validity scientific interpretation the simple answer is that researcher been aware and taken the best possible to avoid or avert them such as by trying to identify which and have the various research process there are grounds to rely on the interpretation not because it is true but because it a well hypothesis without significant in the research process reductionism and biological that there is no need for social scientific inter because in the final analysis all ge can be reduced to about physical social phenomena can be reduced to group psychology which in turn can be reduced to individual psychology which in turn can be reduced to neurology which in turn can be reduced to cellular biology and so on until we reach the physical level at which physical provide for all phenomena at higher this view reductionism is in strong dispute so here it is crucial to distinguish between methodological reductionism and general reductionism in some research methodological may chapter p page dictate the exploration or more that can influence the without that other are unimportant we have no that can acquire data and at the same time investigate the whole our attention must be on something more specific methodological reductionism can be meaningful and necessary even though we refute general reductionism if for instance we wish to examine a biological relationship it may be necessary to ignore an ancillary social relationship conversely examine a social relationship it may be necessary to ignore a biological relationship methodological reductionism is as long as the that we examine are sensible it becomes problematical only when a set is systematically such as by the correlation between poverty social deprivation and disease there are many against reducing social phenomena to physics two are here the first problem the reductionist is that it is doubtful that individual psychology can be reduced to cal dispute on the precise description relationship between psychological phenomena and cerebral activity and today we seem no closer to the mind brain riddle than we were a century ago link in the reductionistic chain reductionism as a whole cannot be carried out the other problem for the reductionist is that many social phenomena are emergent that is they are socially not reducible as they occur at particular social and have no meaning when reduced to lower individual psychology neurology paper money for example is an emergent social phenomenon a no value itself unless you keep it for its portrait charles it cannot be fo r gold or other at the central bank but it is in social that enable it to be for goods or worth otherwise it is just a small rectangular scrap emergence at the social level also may be to a particular set or for instance most have the institution but the concrete married and the social effects vary from society to society the human penchant to form pair philosophy of p page might be reduced to the biological level but the concrete institution in a particular society cannot be similarly reduced however it is clear that the concrete non reducible institution human and con so a full description of these and is possible only on the social level are right scientific effort in the social sphere is useful and it may employ that differ from those applicable at lower statistics are often useful in research that use quantitative whenever we take from a well defined population we express the statistical confidence interval and consequently permit their gen eral extension to other similar in principle that that from research in the may be directly applicable to in norway however it is worth that such generalization is acceptable only when we have grounds to assume that the are in fact similar as by assuming that there is no biological difference between and generalization may be used in much the same way in quantitative social research but statistical cannot be used in research that is not quan does this imply that understanding in social science research cannot be generalized were statistical generalization the only form available understanding could not be generalized yet there is a form that is not quantitative and is frequently used across all the it is theoretical or conceptual ion sometimes transferability we often generalize not in exact such as the cure rate for a particular drug but rather within a conceptual or a theoretical frame for instance when teleological based on the theory are used in biology they rest upon a generalization theory not upon a statistical ion social scientific and may be generalized in the same manner in all both statistical and conceptual it is import ant to keep in mind that change with time that chapter p page once were valid can be invalid are in the

philosophy in chapter ethics and scientific con duct comprise a broad subject that is detailed in innumerable works many than this book consequently this chapter is at most a brief overview applicable to research first we delimit the for ethical then move on to discuss the internal ethics and research and finally look at some specific misconduct the fabrication of data and false authorship plagiarism and duplicate publication the external ethics the towards research and the ethics research are in chapter a brief introduction to ethics have a long history going back at least to the socratic in ancient and are an equally venerable component major yet there still is no agreement on the nature correct or best framework or theory for ethical analysis although there is reasonable agreement concerning the core disagreement and the viable for an acceptable ethical framework p page it is for instance relatively clear that moral nihilism and moral relativism are not viable cultural relativism about morality is a fairly commonly position in public debate essentially that differ in morality that these should be and that morality cannot be across although it is clearly a true description state world that different have different moral cultural relativism is unsustainable as a coherent moral position relativism were true moral outside your own culture would be nonsensical universal human even such as the right not to be tor would be meaningless and it would be impossible to make sense notion progress although most for instance believe that the abo is moral progress wherever it cultural relativism is seen as an attractive position in part because two dis are not made the first is between the claim that ethical are versal e g that people is wrong wherever and whenever it and the claim that they are absolute e g that you can never harm a person even to actualize some greater good the second is between inflexibility and context dependency in the application many deem cultural relativism to be attractive because the ostensible alternative is that ethical are absolute and inflexible but strictly speaking a denial relativism only the claim that ethical are universal they may well be non absolute and flexible in their application with sizeable scope for the importance we may for instance claim that respect for is a universal value while still that the exact a right will and must vary between for instance the shape right to privacy will depend in part on whether the prevalent accommodation are communal long or individual moral hold that are universal yet permit leeway in the principal in ethical theory are about whether the basic level evaluation is evaluation world or people and whether the rightness or goodness act is essential in the the three most often used ethical or are listed in box chapter p page is the possible ethical theory it that goodness is primary and the right act as that which goodness in think ing about an action an agent should consider the various possible that he or she could perform and then choose the one that the good con this is equivalent to choosing the act that the goodness of the state world what is that the type act in itself that an act lying should not matter in thinking about whether to perform it the on ly thing that is whether it good different differ in what they count as good whether they claim that good should be and what class the calculation should include the two first between often do not matter for practical but the last difference can have significant for instance it hugely for the ethics research whether some are included in the class for whom good should be the main criticism is that in some they can justify that most people think are wrong for instance the sacrifice of the perhaps even few research in order to gain important scientific knowledge this criticism led to the development variant theory rule rule that we should not consider individual acts in isolation but instead should focus on the that will have the best a rule might for instance that it sense to ethics and scientific conduct box ethical and deontological ethics virtue ethics p page have a rule against lying because following the rule good over time deontological are in some ways the opposite according to deontological the primary concern is whether an act is right not whether it good an act should not be even good various deontological differ in how are determined to be right and in how one should choose which of two wrong acts to perform in a situation in which there is no right action deontological fit well with our to the belief that there are some acts that are wrong in themselves e g torturing the principal criticism is that they fail to explain why for instance white should be considered as seriously wrong as virtue ethics virtue theory from and deontology in that it on the person an act instead the act itself according to virtue the ory it is possible to identify the set and that a morally good person should possess these are the character that are as the morally right action is the action that a virtuous person and that from his or her the main theory are that there is no consensus on a list and that the theory difficulty accounting for the fact that even morally evil people seem able to perform the occasional good act scientific conduct and misconduct let us now consider the ethical in their research clearly we can derive sundry ethical from the general frame work above all can for instance explain why lying and other are problematic in most and that chapter p page deceiving for your own gain is prickly similarly all the ory find the exploitation powerless by the powerful problematic this clearly against well known misconduct ing fabrication plagiarism and false or gift authorship but perhaps we may derive better or more specific guidance on proper scientific conduct from an analysis purpose and research enterprise it is clear from the analysis in chapter that there is no univocal and tested definition or research but most would accept that a core feature is that it at publicly available well knowledge only through a long term effort many different and research indeed that view is in the famous remark that we see further because we stand on the although as it been mischievously pointed out we would also see further stood on the the original remark often is to isaac newton but to have with bernard in the twelfth century accept this categorization as a goal driven activity it sense to ask how the must act in order to achieve the activity this question been extensively by philosopher knut erik tran y and by many most notably robert merton tran y that scientific work is by and three tran y as listed in box ethics and scientific conduct box of internal linkage external all three guide scientific work but in different ways activity did not interact with society at large only the internal would be but because there are with society linkage and external also come into play p page internal internal we distinguish between epistemic that guide the activity individual researcher and social that guide the between and research in a scientific in tran y truth seeking consistency coherency and simplicity and in the social he openness open and honesty he convincingly that unless individual and research accept these and act in accordance with them as an activity at generating knowledge cannot succeed consequently these are mandatory but they are not from the outside they arise through the nature activity linkage and external include utility and relevance and explain why society freedom whereas ultimately external are the society on scientific conduct e g in relation to research evidently there are significant between the y s analysis and those by american sociologist robert merton based on of merton that the scientific community was to a set of by the acronym for communism to communalism when communism contentious universality disinterestedness and organized merton tran y s analysis is significant because it a reason for tain as problematic scientific misconduct even believe that the general ethical do not apply to science or scientific activity tran y that there are purely internal related to the epistemic that science misconduct and why it scientific misconduct is generally to be illicit so it is difficult to assess its general prevalence and to probe its specific that said available that scientific misconduct is not rare chapter p page a recent american survey of clinical trial research

there used to be however the ease simplified the detection and several professional ism detection are now available ethics and scientific conduct p page the most prolific plagiarist times in research probably was e a k who worked in the the and south in the late s the complete extent plagiarism is not known but he is suspected of about full lock another form is the theft for instance there have been when for have seen an interesting idea in a paper they are and have set their laboratory to work on the idea while holding up the process so that they themselves can submit a paper based on the idea before it is one most prominent concerning scientific priority and potential plagiarism was the dispute between luc and robert over who first isolated and the virus now known as and patent on for the virus first but less priority and to get the valuable us patent both the claim other and the dispute was only resolved when the then and to broker an agreement whereby the two agreed to be as virus and to share the the case is well and there is little doubt that used a chapter box tom on plagiarism a verse of a song by tom i can never forget the day i first meet the great in one word he

to call it please research p page virus sample that he had from and essentially isolated the same virus see the by and in a science special collection science cohen authorship about authorship are probably the most common within research on have several within the scientific community they designate who was involved in a work and accord who should share the related to the because of this significance being an author a prominent role in employment and grant authorship thus as a sort that can be later in the researcher s career hence the frequency of is understandable the international committee journal author ship to minimize the number and to ensure that prob can be clearly in appendix note that these primarily concern the sector other may have different the february version is in box ethics and scientific conduct box international committee of medical journal of authorship substantial to conception and design or acquisition of data or analysis and interpretation drafting the article or it critically for important intellectual content final approval version to be should meet and while acquisition collection or general supervision of the research group alone does not justify authorship p page it is generally that there are five main related to authorship see box chapter box authorship exclusion from authorship gift authorship authorship by coercion unsolicited authorship refusal to accept responsibility as an author when other misconduct is exclusion from authorship exclusion from authorship when someone who to a project and the criteria for authorship is not in the although he or she so there is no requirement against their this most often to junior but can also happen where a research group split before publication unjustified exclusion from authorship is tantamount to theft gift authorship is the case where someone who not the criteria for authorship nonetheless is author ship there are different in which gift authorship might occur it may be a swap i give you author status on my paper give me author status on yours it may be to gain the endorsement famous name on a paper to help it through the peer review process it may be a way to improve the in a laboratory or it may be a way for a pharmaceutical firm to get a prestigious name on a review essentially written by the company p page authorship by coercion authorship by coercion commonly when a senior researcher often the head laboratory to be an author on all from the laboratory regardless or not he or she the criteria for authorship unsolicited authorship is where someone is listed as an author without their knowledge or consent an example from the anonymous case committee on publication ethics is given in box ethics and scientific conduct box paper by a company without the knowledge of the a paper was for which there were seven but no corresponding author the only identification had sent the paper was an e mail from a public company when by the editorial office the company confirmed that the paper was to be considered for possible publication the con were then and whether they had given sion for their name to be attached to the paper who was the corresponding author and also wished to declare any conflict of interest this produced a very interesting flurry one author said the paper had been produced as a result seminar to which he and the other con had been he that he was sim ply giving advice to the drug company concerned for which he had received a fee he that a misunderstanding had led the to send the paper for review but that he had no knowledge that they had done so and that the paper be p page unsolicited authorship almost always also ghost authorship that is the person who really wrote the paper is not listed as an author refusal to accept responsibility in that one s name in the paper a person also responsibility for at least a part content yet in many where fabrication or some other misconduct been revealed in a jointly paper people who gladly were listed as suddenly renounce responsibility for the paper this is either in form duct or it to misconduct in authorship without due care as in the manuscript for publication and duplicate publication a final type worth is the phenomena and publication both were by professor the first chairman of chapter another author to say he could remember very little about it and certainly t seen the final document a third author in some distress anxious that he might be accused form conduct and had never thought that his involvement would lead to a paper being to a journal the most interesting letter was from the first author who had subsequently written an editorial for the journal that was fairly critical drug concerned the company who was acting for the drug company she said had the paper on her her knowledge the same company had previously another article to which they had put her name but which she had not written this author very particularly as she wrote to the company that they did not use her name again cope case p page the danish national ethics committee and were taken from the highly salted italian sausage that is usually in thin being backwards and publication seek to maximize the number from a given work done by reducing each to the least publishable unit publication carving up the done into the possible that can still be publication is the sequential are essentially the same but with a few new data included in the analysis each time e g publish ing study with a recruitment of people after data on the first and people have been publication misconduct because it it more difficult for the research to gain an overview complete project an especially problematic type publication is where a large trial is pub at the same time as trial are for instance on the in one or if the link between the complete trial and the part is not made clear in the this may lead to double counting evidence in later or meta analyses publication leads to the literature being with interim which again it more difficult to gain an overview definitive project the limiting case publication is duplicate or multiple publication of the same research as were new in addition to the general effects of publication this a direct deception second journal as most prohibit double publication duplicate publication is generally only acceptable first publication is in an international journal and language and the second publication is in a national language and journal and the relation ship between the two is made clear the investigation and punishment of scientific misconduct the internal value system and tar the external validity so it should be like other ethics and scientific conduct p page this that misconduct should be and that those found guilty should be but who should investigate and what punishment should be out traditionally scientific misconduct be en by the institution the researcher against whom are raised but such an approach is problematic because the institution is not a neutral or disinterested party it in its reputation and in good with grant previously such often led to the sup pression and the persecution whereas more recently they have sometimes led to and severe against accused before a case been fully and impartially consequently several have set up non institutional for ing misconduct an example is the danish on scientific upon which full information is available at portal page fist in danish and english the is established by law as part danish research agency and separate for health natural and technical and social and human respectively an allegation can be made to these against working at danish public or at by public funds an initial investigation will be made and relevant commit tee that there might be a case an ad investigative will be established and in the relevant area at the end investigation a determination is made as to whether misconduct and

animal s holm and introduction the focus chapter is on the basic ethics as it to research with and on it on the more general introduction to goodness and ethics in science in chapter section is concerned with human research ethics it the basic research ethics a closer look at two influential inter national regulatory on human research ethics and specific raised when research are unable to consent by the use in and by the use of vulnerable research it also the role ethics the controversial raised by research on or are not since they will be relevant to very few of this book and the discussion would require an in depth analysis moral status and harris holm a human research ethics is regulated by law or statutory in most as well as at the international level as in section although regulatory differ from country to country the existence with long in significant harmonization national p page and an almost universal acceptance research ethical at the regulatory level section is concerned with animal research ethics and the research the to minimize animal suffering and the question certain require specific basic of human research ethics the basic research ethics are based on the logical view that the typical research project is by the following listed in box please note that this is claim that all share these just that the typical project them chapter box characterization of the typical research project the research is primarily not at the benefit actual research but at gaining knowledge that will be in the future the possibly may be by participation the are socially powerful or at least more powerful than the average participant the are those who know most about the project the have a personal interest in the success project may in clinical research depend on the for their continued clinical care in where the also may be the this that there is an asymmetry in power and knowledge and that the are in a certain sense used so that i e the and future may benefit people in this way is wrong unless they under stand that they are being so used and have agreed to participate otherwise they are truly research this from the more general ethical p page for self determination and respect for bodily integrity there may be where conscription for the common good is accepted but research is not usually seen as one for that it should be or that there is at least a moral obligation to be a research participant see and harris this analysis research context leads to three main ethics listed in box ethics in human and animal box the main of research ethics the potential harm to research should be participation should be voluntary and based on an adequate under standing project should have an absolute right to withdraw from the study box the of voluntary informed consent information full information given full information understood consent consent ability legal and actual voluntarism absence the second is then as a requirement for vol informed consent which can be into four discrete listed in box exactly what full ion is controversial but as in section it is in some detail in international because of p page the centrality consent in research ethics all where cannot give informed consent become problem even if they are not ethically problematic in any other way like other societal research is subject to general concerning social justice that impinge on the choice we should select and recruit research international regulation let us look more closely at two significant and influential national regulatory to substantiate the above to understand better the basic and to discuss some specific these are the ion world medical association appendix and the convention council and its additional protocol on research appendices and appendix the text relevant chapter in the convention itself and appendix is the more detailed protocol although the declaration is technically binding only on who are medical association that is a member it nevertheless the status authoritative human document because it was one first in the area and because it had cant influence on how human research is regulated in most the convention is technically binding on those that have and it but it also will be used by the european court as an aid in interpretation in specific human even against european that have not the convention contain a specification information that should be given to potential research table and it is evident that both require sig to be given to prospective and fur require that this information is understood hence informed consent to research participation is not a simple matter and is best understood as a chapter p page ethics in human and animal table comparison declaration and convention consent and article

methodological its use is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety prophylactic diagnostic or therapeutic method or where a prophylactic diagnostic or therapeutic method is being for a minor condition and the who receive placebo will not be subject to any additional risk or irreversible harm all other declaration must be to especially the need for appropriate ethical and scientific review p page process that both written and oral information engaging the person in reflection concerning the project and the person sufficient time to make up his or her mind as to whether they want to participate only process is successfully is the signature on the consent form a valid mentation in the design recruitment for a specific process it is necessary to consider how much time this process will take and allow adequate time for it unless there is some medical necessity i e treatment to start now and not tomorrow potential should be given ample time to make their decision and should not be into here and now it is well known that informational often are written in complicated language and are thus difficult to understand in order for the average person to understand these they should be no more difficult to read than the sports popular newspaper only when are exclusively among should academic style informational be used unable to consent there are many in which research are legally or factually unable to consent but here only three will be considered research on research on permanently and research in the emergency setting where the disease process a person temporarily unable to consent e g research on stroke or on cardiopulmonary resuscitation with regard to who are not legally able to consent the general rule is that their or can consent to research participation is not against the child but then no researcher should ask for a child s participation is against the interest child because are seen as a vulnerable and exploitable group both and have on what kind can participate in table it been that these are too narrow since are already moral and we have no reason to believe that they do not want to help other people harris holm b the counter argument is that were less narrowly defined will be by more or less unscrupulous although are legally unable to consent they can clearly have valid concerning whether or not they want to participate in a specific research project chapter p page and even are so young that we think they cannot form a valid opinion on such a complex matter they nevertheless need to know what is going to happen to them during the research it is therefore generally accepted that should be informed age appropriate informational and the assent should be sought and any refusal even want the child to participate permanently differ from in that they often have no legally defined proxy decision maker they fall into two who have previously been competent and who have never been competent with regard to consent both are essentially in the same legal position as we do not imply that they are actually comparable to in any other way they cannot consent to research personally but they may in some be able to assent or refuse inclusion in the research can only take place is a proxy who is legally authorized to give proxy consent to research and this proxy must make based on an understanding best of the person person previously been competent the proxy can take account previously expressed and person and decide in accordance with these some allow competent to cute advance concerning their treatment that become operative when the person becomes incompetent these are usually limited to treatment but a few allow advance for research as well in the acute case it is very unlikely that there is a legally proxy because many legal only allow to be through a legal process after the person become incompetent and even is an automatic legal sumption that for instance the spouse becomes the proxy there may be no time to contact the spouse before the patient to be into the research protocol proxy consent may therefore completely block this kind research or make it very very difficult this was for instance the case in the for some during the s when the consent requirement was very restrictively but it is clearly important that research into for instance improvement resuscitation place it is important that research ethics does not become so protective group that it it impossible to do research on their condition and its treatment and leaves them in what the danish research ethicist and drafter version professor ethics in human and animal p page a golden ghetto this been increasingly in recent and from consent for emergency research can now be found both in and as can be seen in table the in are considerably more narrowly than the in especially with regard to what kind that can take place without consent specific arise in especially with regard to the use in the control group is an effective treatment for the condition in question if this is not given to the in the control group and would have received this treatment were not in the trial they are worse they would otherwise have been by being trial and we would know in advance that everyone in the control group would be worse off a small detriment in well being is something a research participant can consent to i e whether my ingrown toe nail is this week or in two time randomization me in the control group but whether it should be possible to consent to a potential ly large detriment in well being is more controversial what like an absolute prohibition use if there is effective treatment available table but this been by the explanatory footnote which to be more a change in position than an the footnote s second clause in alignment with and what we could call low risk or low harm use but the first clause to allow even high risk bo is necessary for compelling and scientifically sound methodological it is difficult to see how this can be ethically unless the scientific q is so important that we truly believe that should be to sacrifice their own and maybe even themselves in the interest a somewhat similar issue in some research where it is methodologically advantageous to have a long washout period where the patient s ordinary therapy is stopped before the patient the trial medication this practice is ethically problematic if there is a significant risk in the washout period chapter p page a considerably more situation in those where placebo research is carried out in a country by a research sponsor from a country here the situation may occur that there is an effective treatment for the condition in question that everyone this treatment in the country but that it is so expensive that no one it in the country where the research place this been the case in a number would placebo in the control group entail a breach or note that to this research sponsor is european according to article additional protocol the answer to this question on the interpretation there are no effective ness to use the formulation is given a global or a local interpretation is this condition satisfied method is not use d here or is it only satisfied method is not used anywhere the reason that this question complicated and murky and the discussion often is that it with other controversial concerning the between rich and poor e g do rich exploit the poor do rich have an obligation to help the poor is in another country research that you would not allow at home hypocritical or expressive we may note that no one in the control group is actually worse this scenario in the control group do not get effect treatment but they would not have received it anyway had not been research it been that this the research accept able either on its own or research furthermore will benefit the munity in which the research is carried out there is however still no agreement on this issue vulnerable research there are that are vulnerable to exploitation not because they are unable to give consent but because they are socially powerless or dependent on the in some way for these the voluntarism consent becomes an issue and will often require specific justification such a group is chosen as the research population and or assurance that it will be made even more clear than ethics in human and animal p page usual that participation is purely voluntary and that it is acceptable to refuse and that this will have no negative epidemiological and research it is evident that the model covered by research ethics is derived from typical clinical research but large scale epidemiological research is gaining in importance and it is increasingly combined with the analysis cal from large structured sample these are often long duration they may use data and collected for lated and the focus research may change during the life pro this that the ideal situation informed consent at the beginning of the project becomes problematic for how this problem can be include broad or unspecific consent and some form consent a requirement for recurrent or consent to new data and clearly a significant burden on and such may be impossible to obtain are untraceable or dead this idea thus been strongly by the research community however broad consent is not unproblematic the the consent is the less valid it is have i really con to a given use in the ethical sense term consent if i have to any future use and the use is one that neither i nor the could envisage at the time in research ethics there is great resistance to the idea that consent some form between researcher and research participant but considering consent as a contract is prob ably the only way to justify on broad consent it also been that epidemiological research on non sensitive may not require consent because there is no possibility the research however this argument not been universally accepted the role of research ethics to ensure that the research ethics are to are to submit a research protocol the relevant patient information chapter p page and consent to an in some known as research ethics board reb or institutional review board for approval before the project the will typically have both professional and lay and will assess the scientific validity proposal any ethical that the project and the information and consent and will decide whether the project should be to begin or whether need to be approval is a legal requirement in many and it is by the requirement that they will only publish research that approval in some also have control concerning the actual conduct research that is whether it is in accordance with the protocol data protection good clinical practice and other research specific research ethics regulation is not the only kind that the ethical conduct research and the work most have data protection that independently require consent for the collection and identifiable health data except for official statistical pur it may also be necessary to obtain permission from the national data agency to store and process person identifiable health data some also have specific concerning the storage and use of human tissue and these again require explicit consent for research use in many the international good clinical practice that apply to all research to support registration or medical in the the european union and japan also require explicit informed consent from all research and approval by an independent this that even and suddenly there would not be much difference in the basic ethical for the conduct research on adult competent human only the more concerning specific would be affected ethics in human and animal p page the ethics of animal research the two basic in the ethical analysis research are whether it is at all justifiable to use in research and the under which it is justifiable it is immediately obvious that the standard justification for human research will not work in the case cannot consent to be research and there is no way in which the animal can voluntarily take upon that being a research subject even in veterinary research at a specific species some argue that the use in research cannot be at all since research on the animal s right to life or animal suffering it is highly controversial whether can have a right to life and who would have the obligation to protect that right it is however generally accepted that can suffer that their well being can be negatively affected it is very difficult to argue that animal suffering morally should not matter at all the main reason it is wrong to kick your dog is simply that it the dog pain not as immanuel to believe that it you to the degree that animal research pain and other we therefore need a justification for causing this pain what is the good that out the suffering the answer is that the good is the scientific knowledge and the future medical that flow from animal research although it is sometimes by ani mal there is no doubt that animal research been and to be a necessary component long and complicated research lead ing to medical progress but this is still not sufficient to provide a compelling for the practice research a further argument is to show that the amount suffering by research is by the beneficial outcome medical or veterinary progress to make that assessment is extremely complicated partly because we have no good handle on the magnitude various involved that is the animal suffering and the human and animal suffering averted and partly because it is difficult to estimate the exact contribution research to medical the argument so far been on the general level research as one comprehensive activity this that even accept that animal research is in general we do not necessarily have to accept that every chapter p page individual project is there may well be individual where the do not outweigh the suffering of the experimental the official regulation research therefore two first to ensure that the general level suffering by animal research is this is for instance the justification for training and cation and laboratory and good housing for all laboratory secondly to evaluate individual or research to ensure that there is an acceptable balance between suffering and benefit in each case over the a consensus that a useful tool for reaching these is the three approach based on initially by russell and current three are listed in box ethics in human and animal box the three refinement improvement lifetime experience of to reduce suffering and improve welfare reduction the use in each experiment without promising scientific output and the quality research and testing and without compromising animal welfare replacement the use that permit a given scientific pur pose to be without or other on living council on some now require to specify how they have taken the three into account in their project because suffering are so central in the standard approach to animal research ethics the most problematic category is usually taken to be where the animal for a long time in a p page state some suffering in contrast where the animal is experimented upon and then painlessly are to be less problematic here it is important to note that a significant proportion of short and long term toxicological that fall into the most problematic cat are legally as part testing and a question that still controversy is whether there should be different for different and what the rational basis for that protection is for instance some have had special cat for that are traditionally kept as so that you could carry out in that you could not carry out in dogs such special protection for that we happen to like does not seem rationally warranted whatever evidence there is that can suffer to the same degree as dogs and that they are probably more intelligent than dogs a more rational approach is to consider what kind an animal can experience based on its cognitive and species specific sentience is the basic criterion for any kind but there are other than pain that usually live in social may suffer in single and ani that have higher cognitive may like suffer from bore dom in an unstimulating environment or may suffer because anticipation to come different have these con differently in their but a typical classification ing protection would be not non no specific protection because not to be sentient increasingly a few also protect non human primates great many now prohibit or strongly discourage research on great chapter p page a hierarchical list like this is clearly not sufficiently sensitive to all the many between animal species and it is therefore important that both and laboratory are knowledgeable about the specific specie s they are working with so that they can minimize species specific suffering e g that have as a normal behaviour should have in their and that live in social should not be individually animal research and other of in most there are quite stringent concerning the use in research and about the breeding and housing there is often a glaring inconsistency between these and the or absence concerning other human whereas all prohibit cruelty to there is often very little enforcement exotic can be kept as without knowing anything about their for well being are used in dangerous sports where many will suffer one mammal can be used to hunt and kill another mammal no we are not thinking about fox hunting in the but about the of domestic all over the world and perhaps most importantly in farm are kept under that are much worse than the con for laboratory it is worth considering whether animal should not first target these other much more problematic of before animal experimentation even may want to bene fit from progress bought through the suffering in research should be to veto their participation in clinical research journal ethics harris j

analysis and petter introduction the drive progress in science that is most famously by the each year since for outstanding in chemistry physics physiology or medicine for literature and for peace just what achievement been since ancient times in the an achievement might be classed as a discovery or as an improvement a discovery is the finding previously unknown such as roentgen s discovery or the discovery an improve ment is the better alfred s achievement of kieselguhr an absorbent in highly unstable to make dynamite a stable explosive was an improvement with today s level knowledge spectacular are few likewise few can have as rewarding as alfred s invention which the business on which he built the fortune that now funds the most achieve through to the greater body of scientific knowledge such as by providing support for a view or hypothesis that is generally accepted but not proven in concert can be significant as p page by an example within the covered by this book early in the century the hypothesis that between nerve by not electrical was accepted though unproven yet before the first was scientific are classed ne ither as nor as improve but nonetheless bring about prog mathematical can in or insufficient for opinion improving or testing laboratory may be significant the special are a prerequisite for the work of a large number in basic research applied research and other big science as well as for successfully appealing to those who provide it all to make the scientific world see box for other chapter box on scientific unfortunately is not all there is to the scientific our even more important than is finding relevant prob that really matter the world us an infinite number to solve we select some and much art science is then which prob to concentrate on and which to ignore the ability to solve logical thinking and hence a rational mind whereas the ability to identify consequential is only in part based on logic mostly it is based on instinct intuition sub conscious perception a sixth sense inborn proclivity talent irrational impulse or whatever you might want to call it there is plenty from the history for an assortment two in all it to have thorough knowledge to be prepared for the and to see between dissimilar scientific with intuition and p page imagination pasteur that chance the prepared mind so serendipity indeed s entertaining story about the three from now sri is often in scientific as by austin your scientific problem first and foremost a problem must have significance its solution must have value not just fascination for you the goal may require time and effort so avoid plan thoroughly in advance many have long been known but not tackled because the to solve them were not available biology such as the structure material the thesis and the regulation activity were before the of developmental biology could be how does a egg develop into a complete multicellular organism technology is often said to build on basic research but information can flow the other way a new technique method or apparatus often the solution older overripe problem in biology that is worthy but learning a technique and it repetitively for all it is worth technically not problem research which is hardly praiseworthy and can spawn many box research methodology and analysis box on untrodden and unexpected in basic research everything is just the opposite what you need at the out set is a high degree otherwise it t likely to be an import ant problem you start with an incomplete roster by their ambiguity often the problem the between unrelated you must plan on the basis even bare possibility rather than certainty experiment turns out precisely as this can be very nice but it is only a great event the same time it is a surprise you can measure the quality work by the intensity the surprise can be p page sir peter the philosopher who the prize in physiology or medicine with sir frank burnet that is the art soluble accordingly you should conduct definitive enquiry that either or your working hypothesis be bold attack your hypothesis from several try to falsify it so that you do not end up with a so what paper it must be possible to disprove the hypothesis heed the principle of s s razor that is select the simple choose preferably the hypothesis or explanation that is compatible with the you seek to interpret complex with many and thereby that require hypothesis are uninspiring and difficult to falsify also be a bit lazy in the sense that your set up is not overly involved lest you increase the risk on the way and proceed unhurriedly step by step so that you always have an overview potential and project your experiment or intervention must have the requisite often show their best in the method and other included in their experimental design appropriate are vital a control should differ from the test in only one aspect that is the variable being gated be it a chemical a training scenario whatever the control should be con with the test the control should be in accord with the test the control in accord with the test and the control phase in accord with the test phase in experimental that serve as their own versus experimental phase as an aside you may advantageously eliminate interindividual by for experimental organ or cell to be their own con such as by successively test and control chapter because it did turn out as in some is accepted as a high yield or it can be because the prediction was wrong and something totally unexpected turned up the look problem and a new kind either way you win thomas p page reproducibility is as vital as relevance and congruence a publishable finding should not be before it is replicated in one or preferably two new independent likewise you should be until they have been confirmed by inde pendent research more on scientific all science on and causal explanation is routine in the natural causality can be straightforward whenever there is only one cause yet most often several causal may act to produce an effect causal represent a natural start ing point for understanding or explaining an phenomenon however or should not be relation ship cannot be by cause and effect regardless starting point taken in the philosophy causal thought into the explanation of the empirical essential to the hypothetical deductive method understanding is enhanced through hypotheses that can be by empirical for further discussion see section research between connected to the starting for or and the used for explanatory the variable to be studied is the outcome variable the response variable or the effect variable whereas the variable used for explanatory is the explanatory variable the predictor variable or the exposure variable the research hypothesis a description association between the out come variable and one or more explanatory the hypothesis that we seek to falsify the null hypothesis is that there is no association between the out come variable and at least one explanatory literature and the body literature is extensive and overwhelming you cannot know it all but you should have a solid and not overly narrow basic knowledge so that you can think straight and sense what is and what is not biologically plausible moreover you must be sure that your work does not simply duplicate that already research methodology and analysis p page carried out by through the by the various data bases e g in it is possible to set up search that include important and the within your subject field see section that said getting with the actual practical work also is essential lest too much time be spent in theoretical preparation for it it is tough being the lone ranger but beneficial group you are in can divide reading among and hold regular literature choosing the optimal and is decisive for the experimenter the question can be to approach the scientific problem test experimental an organ culture a cell culture or a sub cellular system often the best procedure is to think through and possibly conduct at several preferably in the reverse order with the and most controllable set up first the higher in the test hierarchy the greater the chance for physiologically meaningful but also for misleading for example inject a new hormone in an experimental animal there is a non negligible risk that the concentration at the locus and the time effect profile are above and beyond the physiological many ago a member academic appraisal committee wrote that the given to mice would have been more suitable for an elephant conversely it is possible that the agent you inject or in some other way so rapidly that you observe no effects at all or a compensatory mechanism might take over or the mechanism you seek under special as often been the pointing experience with that otherwise seem to have no an substance a can provoke the secretion b which in turn measured response c that a c is then slightly sketchy maybe response c is not at al l because physiological negative feedback contribute to steady state and thereby reduce c to an unmeasurable level removing one cause does not guarantee improvement in the patient s self esteem misleading or can also deceive whenever one works with that are simpler than intact perhaps the best precaution is meticulously to chart the experimental set up as outlined in box but it is easy to be many new cancer promising following chapter p page encouraging on experimental or in on cancer have dis upon finally being tested on often we are most interested in valid for people nonetheless are often elsewhere for instance the early of research methodology and analysis box experimenter s precision quartile interval coefficient

precise were not yet available to conduct similar on human nerve indeed on can reveal and not as readily observable in human in any event the lack phenomena such as tickling by strenuous exercise migraine and is due in part to an absence comparable animal and in part to their not being amenable to in study consequently the hold great promise include mouse anaemia that is similar in many to mediterranean anaemia and another model that ostensibly schizophrenia it is less expensive and less emotionally stressful to use small ani such as mice and rather than moreover small may be selectively bred to be as alike as identical momentous must be made before livestock or dogs are used but in or where cannot be used dogs are preferable to because the neural regulation vagus tonus at rest dog heart is the closer to that human heart in any case it is best as well as often convincing to reach in many ways such as by a scientific problem at several however this is an ideal that may be audacious in practice particularly are new in a research group and attempt to change its ways time available is your most limited resource and as an old adage never change a winning team the experimental set up is certainly thorough and proven and many data are available for further experimentation that said a reluctance to bring in new and may easily result in stagnation so it is advantageous group as a whole occasionally and you can take part in that effort it is wise first to gain experience through the literature on mater and but do not postpone going to where are routine in that you save effort and may gain new research research hypotheses are studied through collected data medical comprise experimental and observational the chapter p page experimental include clinical which are on the goal empirical is to arrive at valid reproducible con concerning this is through well with valid and valid analyses the experiment which an intervention is by a study association between the outcome variable and a single explanatory variable for instance this is the case in a study effect new drug in other an assessment there a difference in the outcome variable between a treatment group and a placebo group the equivalent situation in tory exploring for example the effect hormone on the growth rate in a cell culture causal are often multifactorial even then the effect single explanatory variable can be studied by test into two that differ by that variable alone this is the case when test are random into treatment and placebo randomization that the two are identical save for the explanatory cause variable to which the group is subjected an experiment that testing a hypothesis on a single causal factor also the statistical analysis in that only the difference between needs to be statistically tested observational differ from experimental in that they are factorial because a arrangement in test or control cannot be nonetheless the influence particular causal factor on the between the test group and the control group is often it is not directly possible to assess in an observational study as causal are not included in the design that is through randomization the causal factor must be and can be studied through cal analysis statistical confounding when the effect is with the effects of other the effects may be reduced through appropriate design or through special statistical analysis in or clinical randomization is meant to eliminate the effects in observational confounding is more severe so are used to reduce its effects in statistical control other than the principal explanatory variable is accomplished by the use statistical research methodology and analysis p page model that all the principal causal the effect causal factor may then be analyses include linear regression analysis logistic regression and cox analysis in the medical and biological are listed in box chapter box observational cross sectional and cohort and longitudinal case control cross sectional and are on a study population at a particular time at that time the study population may include people at various phases illness or with various causal illness the outcome variable and the causal are not tracked over time so a cross sectional study is not well to exploring the relationship between cause and effect a cross sectional study is to the prevalence but not the incidence illness see also section cohort are prospective or follow up study in the association between causal and an illness we start with a healthy population and study test until the illness or the study is stopped key include progress and survival stud that are often duration the information on the association between the causal and the illness in the number and the length low up time before the illness age other causal and the outcome variable are over time so this sort is well to examining the relationship between cause and effect and both the incidence and prevalence disease may be studied typical follow up include those between the incidence and nutrition or diet longitudinal are on test or experimental through repeated over time at the same time the progress p page outcome variable and that causal are studied data are acquired through repeated so the do not include follow up time but are limited to that the disease and the in the causal before a particular point in cohort the study population is usually until an event and then the low up time is longitudinal are useful whenever there are rapid in disease or causal they are well for the between causal and effect include effects upon growth in or as with monthly such may be over or a drawback and longitudinal is that they are duration and are costly moreover a long term study often from the loss test the challenge in a study then is to ensure that a decline in the number oftest does not threaten its validity or case control are by the test being selected with the outcome variable as the starting point in the outcome vari able is by ill healthy which in turn become the case test and the control respectively the causal ma y be retrospectively back in time to examine time lapse case control may be by matching to other than the main explanatory variable s such as age and gender in this manner the sample oftest is with respect to the match ing and the process may be as a randomization in an effort to re create the situation classic experiment in cancer epidemiology with diet or sun exposure are often studied in case control data provide data and data must be to provide the basis of valid and reproducible in the natural statistics such as mean median variation and are these mag are in ways that depend on the included in an analysis and they are expressed on scales suiting their nature the are numerical so the scales accordingly are as in turn the research methodology and analysis p page scales affect the presentation data the choice effect measure and the statistical analysis as listed in box there are two principal cat and numerical chapter box data nominal are exclusive and are exclusive and integer continuous any in a range of or unrestricted categorical data are classified into nominal or ordinal data smoking is an example nominal variable with a division into non smoker category value and smoker category value ordinal data are in in a way such that there is underlying smoking comprise an example data with the smoker category value former smoker category value smoker category value and daily smoker category value numerical data are count data or continuous data p page data acquired over time or space may be expressed in discrete such as count data the number an event for instance per year is a typical example continuous data are by the measurement typical include weight concentration blood pressure and age for which the data comprise the actual technical proficiency is essential as it the experimenter to rely upon and reproduce as in other proficiency comes from practice practice and more practice you must develop a feel for how work in your perform a series and register the spread preferably expressed as the coefficient standard deviation arithmetic mean you might precisely measure blood haemoglobin level with an analytical while your serum analysis a this the number in the test and control the more precise the analysis the parallel measure are to find a mean value with a low degree or a sig difference between two at this point it often may be wise to consult a statistician to perform a power calculation cannot perform it yourself that is you should calculate the amount so that you can for instance assume with probability that you can reveal a differ between two at the level when the analytical plus the logical which estimation variance are known systematic error is essential that is your work must be accurate precision and accuracy are often confused but may be distinguished by example shoot at a target with a rifle on which the are skewed your may fall close to each other high precision but systematically be up to the right of the bull s eye low accuracy accuracy that you calibrate your measuring against a standard which may or may not be available the nature procedure will determine how often you or your instrumentation engineer must recalibrate the the principal control as at a large hospital tory may be a paradigm for a research laboratory they are as two research methodology and analysis p page are used with known stated and control mate rial used daily are used to establish working or standard the functional connection between instrument response and analytical some are by independent but for many analyses the only available are those by the instrument manufacturer as part reagent kit are used to monitor analytical quality as in the daily internal quality control in which control material in various is included in all analyses are often included in long series usually at the start in the middle and at the end to monitor for instrument drift the should be at least at two one low and one high when the working charac or standard curve is linear and at three when the characteristic is non linear for diagnostic the should bracket the range over which the exact measurement data are decisive for whether clinical intervention is for pure technical quality assurance as in a research project there should be a control in the middle as well as at either end working range where standard deflect such as at ed and ed in in principle other than those provided by the manufacturer are preferable although in practice this is often not possible as in analyses for many analyses may be made in house by freezing that later can be just before use should have the same matrix that is the same composition content ion as that test material moreover at to six times a year external murex send out control for analysis so that may report back their this procedure is external quality assessment some set may require exceptional vigilance to spot systematic might change experimental animal or might its breathing have an effect do subjective enter the picture for example do you record from the nerve take blood from the most accessible count in preparation in which you expect to find many chapter p page type that you hope are numerous in such the recording should be blinded the course response for an analysis is a rule ship and may be essential for proper performance experiment moreover you may profit in future in which a particular dose can be selected for continuation n either saturation or half maximum effect ed may be chosen in such you need to know the strength dose response relation time lapse also is significant for example in a subsequent trial you may wish to record data at a time when you are certain that the maximum response will occur perhaps your experimental apparatus a long response time that you may wish to alter or at least be aware of a lethargic mechanical part might be by an electronic component or other latency may be removed when non invasive ultrasonic blood flow available and invasive on experimental it possible to measure blood flow in and by recording in the course couple corroborate that in the were triggered by not which act more slowly it is also to know whether measurement are stable over a period so reducing the need to recalibrate or compensate for drift an mental set up is splendid can document a stable base level then observe an outcome resulting from the experimental intervention and finally return to base level when the intervention in such it is advantageous to compare the measured with the two nearly identical control phases for in the researcher must preside over physicochemical such as temperature and gas pressure positive are also essential particularly with negative positive are related to or control material in various and to dose response but are most often used at higher more complex for example for a particular intervention an effect was not as this may be in many ways you may have your working hypothesis been misled by a compensatory reaction in a experimental animal or test subject that more or less masked the response research methodology and analysis p page you not actually in the way you thought you would such as because a chemical agent no longer was active past its best by date or used that have lost their ability to respond then you are in a position where you must document that the intervention as it should for example find that a graft versus host reaction does not affect blood formation as assumed then the occurrence genuine reaction must be confirmed such as by enormous spleen growth sensitivity control goes a step farther in that you must show not only that an intervention acts but also document a strength effect relation as above for individual analyses stimulus strength to elicit the desired effect or outcome is physiologically unreasonable you are on thin ice stimuli can cause various in intact stress or may have triggered the measured effects large drug or other may have unspecific effects sensitive and tissue that are more or less roughly handled in can react otherwise in cell comprise that do not necessarily respond in culture as do normal in cell also can change apparently spontaneously they can be infected by or be subjected to genetic or epigenetic transformation such as these remind us importance or negative before telling the media that you have discovered a remarkable substance that cancer it is best to check that it does not also kill normal moreover you should definitely not publish in the general media before your scientific paper is perhaps a more realistic example might be that you have isolated a factor that specifically a type to secrete a particular hormone you must then show that you have an actual secretion process and not the result damage as by release cytoplasmic enzyme such as lactate dehydrogenase furthermore specificity should be proven by confirming that the effect via a particular receptor this can be done by blocking the effect with an antagonist or antibody to the receptor alternatively you may use a or inhibitory molecule that or messenger for the receptor protein or create a knock out mouse that the receptor and hence also the hormone secretion that you have shown in wild type specificity can also occur in an intact organism for chapter p page geographical even though you cannot demonstrate it in and are site specific in an organism and have no remote effects as they cannot diffuse at a distance finally you should have further study these may be milieu test usually should be at rest balanced fasting comfortable and properly informed on the nature study see section of chapter experimental should be handled according to to their new environment in the local experimental animal you must give proper consideration to diurnal physiological variation preferably by recording data at the same time each day anaesthesia analgesia and respiratory fluid and electrolyte should all be and standardized these are parallel to those physical and chemical for in repeatability reproducibility and reliability in the design analysis structure must be distinguished from variation structure that which is sought about a problem such as is a differ between a new and an old drug or is an association between the concentration and the effect drug variation because test are with measuring that never are completely precise and because we observe with other error is small structure is readily observable large variation can complicate the task in the variation or the random error a distinction is made between repeatability and reproducibility repeatability is understood as the degree to which the same are seen when are repeated under identical experimental in turn identical experimental denote identical and repeatability is expressed by the variation coefficient x where x is the mean and the standard deviation of the defined by the research methodology and analysis p page to understand the concept note also that whenever data follow a normal distribution about will fall within x reproducibility is understood as the degree when the study change it may for example depend on the measurement method or on the observer hence in a study it is wise to consider the that may cause variation for instance in a study in blood pressure we must assess the that may cause variation they may include the are in a supine or sitting position measurement apparatus used and time when the measure are made after all such have been considered we can assess the that are vital and create variation and perhaps control them in the design experiment whenever the variation experimental method is unknown it is wise to start with a preliminary study that assessment repeatability and the reproducibility to be made are meant as to identify and estimate the reproducibility say over measure ment apparatus or for instance an assessment degree to which a supine or sitting position blood pressure measurement should be made before a blood pressure study by on test sub in this way a measure is that the between measurement as well as between test the measure of reliability is calculated as the correlation coefficient for data and as cohen s kappa coefficient for categorical data cohen s kappa coefficient is a variety for categorical data so it is sufficient to describe briefly consider an assessment reliability experimental method a study is by on the same test sub different the concept computation such as or cohen s kappa coefficient is as let s the variance among test this is the between variation further let s the variation associated with test which is the within variation it because several are on the same test subject is the ratio chapter p page between variation and the total variation accordingly is a measure that between and and the closer to the higher the reliability high reliability is when the within variation and hence the variation between measurement is small two are on each test subject one with each test this the following set up with here x and x are the the two x is the mean two measure and s is the variance among the test and thereby between the test the study are given by then s i x i for the within variation for test person i and the total within variation is s w s i further s b n ni x is the variation between the then we have an estimate correlation as s w s w example a study to assess the reproducibility pressure with respect to a supine or sitting position this is done by measuring the blood pressure test in both a supine measurement and a sitting measurement position all test are measured in both so that both within and between people can be the are listed in table in this study s w and s b the variation between is far greater than that within so high reliability is in add there is no one answer to the question a reliability check is to ensure agreement between two but a guide line is given in box box that there is nearly perfect agreement between the measure example above for the supine and sitting research methodology and analysis p page chapter table blood pressure of test in two box reliability degree of agreement between two measurement or poor moderate good very good reliability are particularly requisite in reproducibility measurement or in with repeated on the same test another example is analysis reliability agreement on the same test by different validity effect choice of statistical test there are three as listed in box as its name concept validity is associated with the concept being studied while internal and external validity concern the drawn from a study validity consideration the or p page research methodology and analysis box validity concept validity internal validity external validity box internal validity may be by sample selection bias information bias statistical confounding are real which is germane to all research validity also to a large gap between drawn and data acquired may indicate poor validity even though a chemotherapeutic agent cold virus in a cell culture you cannot conclude that it is a good medicine for the common cold and even though report an average working week of it is not certain that they actually work that much concept validity the degree to which the data reflect the that we wish to study but cannot register directly the problem studied should be to be suitable and adequate and accordingly several or may be used this is particularly the case in social medicine and psychiatry a variable is said to be valid whenever association is strong such that the data are relevant to the approach internal validity is associated with valid inference in a population studied and consequently potential as listed in box bias can occur when the sample is not representative population we want to study non response or exclusion from a study may induce bias loss of seriously the validity study and is a particular problem in long duration and in study in which defection is different in the p page being from clinical may be when the treatment group and the placebo group differ information bias whenever test report incorrectly or when the information registered in a study is flawed in other ways this in which is particularly serious whenever misclassification between studied such as in clinical with treatment and placebo or in case control research in the medical and biological statistical and statistical testing internal validity is by improper use of for example statistical validity on the right effect and statistical so as to avoid type i and type see section of chapter the effect measure is derived from the outcome variable it is the quantity that the statistical description circumstance in a study for example there may be a mean difference in the outcome variable between a treatment group and a placebo group the effect estimate along with its in the form confidence interval us to assess the significance study the p value information on the degree to which the result sample can be generalized to apply to a study population many choose as a threshold for the statistical significance result and consequently present only p less than usually there is no reason to reduce the information in the p value to a statement or not significant so the p value is that said p higher than may contain considerable information a valid statistical analysis the listed in box chapter box presentation of main statistical effect estimate possibly for confounding uncertainty effect estimate expressed as a confidence interval preferably or more hypothesis expressed in p p page most have more than one effect measure and entail more than one statistical test limit for a test is set at the probability of at least one will be greater than so the significance individual must be to preclude excessive testing such as by the multiple comparison correction the choice statistical method is close ly associated with the effect measure used which in turn is closely related to the type for the table an overview and statistical used with various regardless method used a valid statistical analysis will contain the listed in box external validity generalization such as by the population to which a conclusion may be generalized it is a complex challenge as research methodology and analysis table statistical for independent and dependent nominal data two or more relative risk chi squared test s test regression ordinal data two or more difference in mann sign test test s test test count data two or more incidence rate regression continuous data two or more difference in t test paired t test difference mann sign test in test s test test continuous regression linear regression repeated explanatory coefficient variable p page depend on design population and statistical model the relation between the sample and the population is essential yet regardless meticulous we have been in and analysis a discussion validity is to a great degree marked by and and not clear criteria that said should be explicit such that the reader may assess the external validity experimental protocol an experimental protocol is usually as part application for research it perseverance to think meticulously through all the and choice instead to the laboratory and starting work yet you have to in any case ethics experimental animal and the like will require a pro description before you are to start even preliminary research even if risk assessment is not it is wise to think ahead not least to minimize the chance in practical work or work already done as well as the number pilot count on the pro taking three times as much time as you anticipate at the outset you may supplement the basic experimental protocol with elsewhere in this chapter as in box on the for an consult perhaps by holding a seminar in your research group and in it who may put in a word or two that are in collaborative research they must be

systematic error will the essential change simply because will they for instance change with the year apparatus wear lapse material and or the effects on biological observer bias is to be as above and in box subjective such as differential blood must be blind that is with hidden identification with human should be double blind so that neither the test nor the research are aware of whether a subject is in the test group or the control group chapter hypothesis for example suppose the hypothesis is that a high fat diet can result in premature death suppose also that it is known that rich in fat can cause obesity to show that obese have a life expectancy in comparison with non obese does not necessarily support the original hypothesis obese might differ from con not only in the size fat but also in the intake other a decisive test hypothesis would require the two to be identical in all degree of obesity and dietary except for fat intake scott box example of observer bias experimenter effects the experimenter effect is particularly prominent in research where people exchange unintentionally without speak ing these may be by by auditory or visual p page you should state how you will process

thereafter the chapter the principal used in medicine identify the best source literature may be electronic print or both no one single to all medical is the best known principal but it should not be

literature search the relationship between the different can be in figure where the best are those within the shaded area literature search and personal reference meta of review article how to formulate a query pico each and every search with a query a concise query is one of the most important in the search process a literature search begun with only a vague concept to look for may well produce vague it is therefore time well spent to structure a search in advance new on search strategy often come to mind during a search but that does not preclude the clarification in advance literature are on each s own and a search strategy several will improve the conduct search and provide a better perspective over the strategy used begin by dividing the query into and and use a thesaurus to find relevant search in the example here mesh medical p page subject are used to search in be aware that other data bases use other subject for example its own thesaurus pico a approach pico the acronym for population patient problem intervention comparison outcome is a useful tool in a search strategy although may not have all four constituent most will have two or three of them the exhaustive literature search not all are involved in all are listed in and the search sequence the common to basic and clinical research while ancillary relevant to clinical research are given in box example query does urban air pollution cause an increase in the mortality population chapter box systematic literature search in basic and clinical research what is the question an approach which on the problem will define the search the subject which and are the most suitable in order time frame how far back is far enough listing print based fully exploit the knowledge and search assess the

keep the search history as part documentation state the used and time covered p page in a search strategy remember that the making the in the use the most specific subject to describe the content of each article so use a thesaurus such as mesh to find subject and their to each other remember that subject can have their own that is they may have been in the course check scope note mesh browser in and formulate the search strategy accordingly as no indexing is completely correct in all you should consider search and search some support searching several bases in one operation select more than one to search it can be a tempting short cut however such a search across cannot take into consideration their thesauri and so on have shown that a large number are indexed in different ways depend ing on the base such as in and hence cross whenever the goal is to find all available information on a particular topic however at the beginning work a cross search will identify inter to be one by one think and do not rely on only one term in addition perform an author search selection use several bibliographic use various or secondary s related function us national library s locator plus subject heading versus publication type a subject heading term content whereas a publication type a category or the manner in which the information is consequently subject heading and publication type must not be confused with each other as their differ publication type is a criterion for limiting a search as stated under for the individual chapter p page for example in the subject heading plural to that or discuss while trial singular limited as publication type that actually are the same for meta analysis mesh and meta analysis publication type and review literature mesh and review literature publication type whenever the subject heading and publication type are identical as in these meta analysis and review literature are in the same way as any other a search may be limited the

whether the term should restrict only to for which it principal content limit by focus article major topic consider in literature on a single topic limit to the major topic in literature on more than one topic do not limit to the major topic be cautious in limiting to try to limit the search in other ways for example by human or publication type methodology literature search and personal reference p page for concerning only use the human limit limiting also with not animal further the number because many are assigned indexing human and animal be cautious in limiting to a specific language to

analyses the medical genetics entry related to various in medical genetics quality critical appraisal upon completion basic literature search work by sifting from the list to de which or other media should be read in detail at this point it is natural to contact the local library to order not in your own collection there is no simple way to deter mine whether a work quality but there are a few to keep in mind in whether a more thorough evaluation is some concern your own work the extent to which your own search tech may be said to be quality and is able for instance to discover chapter p page that some may have been retracted it is also important to check whether your information comes from or from full other relate to the study at hand is it quality to be included in the dossier critical appraisal must be used in this process for example visit for a description see also chapter abstract or full text most in bibliographic such as and include a document in full text may be costly and take time so it is tempting to make do with however as shown by al it is inadvisable to rely only upon s study to assess the degree to which the content was consistent with the content abstracted he found that the proportion varied widely and to a significant degree even for the renowned medical included in the survey lancet jama new journal of medicine annals medicine canadian medical association journal the conclusion was that the content abstract often was inconsistent with or even in contrast to the content article abstracted this that work on information from alone is risky al moreover many people may maintain that it unethical research errata retracted are concerned with keeping abreast in their respective there are several ways to keep informed among them by a current awareness service such as the selective dissemination see section another way is to subscribe to a journal s contents service to receive tables via e mail by in this manner only one may miss subsequently retracted there can be many for a publication the may have for a publication may not accept responsibility for the publication in the worst case the work may have been exposed as research misconduct or fraud regardless severity reason research are retracted every year literature search and personal reference p page yet they remain listed as in marked in various ways retracted publication retraction erratum have shown that differ in the speed in which they trace and register such consequently a paper may be listed in as a valid reference but simultaneously be tagged erratum in this is yet another reason for searching in more than one the individual scientist is obliged to ensure that such incomplete or flawed stud are not included in background material have shown that even though a paper been retracted and marked accordingly in it may appear in who glean from reference by not from their own well literature in can overlook retracted moreover the is unethical to be on the safe side consider finishing all with limit to retracted quality of reference it is wise to note as soon as they are bibliographic man registration it is better to register too many than too few as in the early it is not always clear which will finally be a paramount rule is that you should refer only to you have read in full text regrettably this is not always the case as can be seen by the many incorrect ref that are widely by who uncritically copy reference made by other without the whenever such chicanery is exposed the author s credibility is and the work assessed accordingly have shown that such erroneous may be widespread which extra work for those who strive to find original works impact factor is it possible to assess research quality objectively starting in the science citation index a basis for the impact factor if which is a measure citation frequency average article in chapter p page a particular journal for a given year the if for a specific year is calculated as the ratio over a specific year by in that in the previous two impact factor total number total number in the specific journal the if was never intended to be a universal criterion for quality even though it frequently is so in practice for example may con in to which they should submit may use the if as a criterion in scientific staff the if is also involved in journal and in research funds quite naturally seek assurance that funds are channelled to the scientific in which they will have the benefit and an employer is interested in the best people it is also natural that wish to their works as well as possible but whether the if shall be a decisive criterion is uncertain the if should be used with care because the if does the quality individual article but the average measure use journal as a whole for the two that are included in the calculation usually only a few generate to the journal hence not are also fully it self and non self are now included for each journal preclinical are more often than clinical clinical often cite preclinical understandably the reverse is less frequent as knowledge must be before it is put to clinical use the if cannot be across and owing to citation dynamic continuously new which supplant old knowledge such as biochemistry and molecular biology are owing to the time limit two previous which is used in the if cal work longevity is accordingly less literature search and personal reference p page with are at a disadvantage because supplement series usually generate and accordingly a lower citation frequency review are more often which that publish many such with extensive correspondence have an advantage because although to the editor are not taken into account as a basis the denominator for if to them are included the if is calculated for selected indexed predominantly in english and in the coverage for various is but more than in the subject and the natural some are medical in any case the selection indexed in this single is small in the overall picture according to s directory today some current are in medicine and the logical around the world might mention be preferable to no mention at all if for many research wish to comment on and reject a work exposed as research misconduct this will result in many work which thus the journal s if quality if too many to justify the position hallmark that it as a quality assessment it is preferable to assess according to how many and who cite the rather than only considering the in which the are there is no easy way to assess quality a true appreciation validity will therefore require a knowledge quality for a committee will never approve a horse p access to impact journal citation is available on subscription another approach can be to use a general search engine on the and use impact factor and the journal name as search the home often list their chapter p page literature search and personal reference table how many sectional y few

cell can be cultured in on media by the addition owing to limited access to in the medium immediately beneath the colony the various will eventually reach roughly similar sizes another advantage with this technique is that a single cell as a rule taken up only one vector molecule which is subsequently replicated within the cell each separate colony therefore a unique clone so that by solitary

in the gel an electric field is applied to the gel and the negatively migrate towards the cathode the gel matrix as a sieve that the according to size with smaller more quickly than the are most widely used are more time demanding but give better separation in particular and are therefore used in mutation detection and separation very long tend to get stuck in the gel their release from the gel matrix is by the field field gel electrophoresis causing the long thread like to wriggle through the gel in zigzag up to million in length can thereby be so that for example individual yeast can

hybridization the or must be by blotting onto a membrane with high binding capacity for the transfer of from gel to membrane was first by e m southern and the method for detection chapter p page is consequently southern blot for the similar method was to as northern blot and for western blot or may also be applied to membrane for detection by hybridization with without prior electrophoretic separation directly onto the mem the method is to as dot blot from virus it is a plaque lift and from bacterial a colony lift the chain reaction the chain reaction technique is applied to amplify only specific replication are used to generate in a cyclic fashion so that the number is doubled for every cycle because require a primer at the side the region can be by synthetic single with the

mixture is prepared as for but with a single primer so that only one two is the key chapter p page element by sanger and is the use that when incorporated into the newly strand terminate fur elongation this leads to random termination and the generation of newly single in a discrete spectrum thus for example a fragment of a is indicative that the base in position is a c by the order can be established and thereby the order in the template each four is with a different fluorescent marker the full spectrum is by electrophoresis in narrow and the presence corresponding to different fragment is with a laser source and for each colour this continuous wave like information is fed directly into a computer that will translate the wave into sequence the step in the reaction is per

genome genome from both and are currently out at a rapid pace from large high throughput where most have been fully the are as a rule immediately made publicly available via see section before the are cut into smaller which are in order to see which are we need to generate that over lap in a tiling pattern accordingly the genome is chopped up in such a way that each part genome is on several different to eliminate genome are usually with a six to times coverage with the implication for large that many hundred million need to be and it may then seem surprising that it is not the physical handling and of the large that represent the challenge but the final assembly the reason is that the are with repeated in the human making up almost genome although on different in the genome two recently may be almost identical the question then whether slight between two stem from amplification or whether they reflect different genomic loci or whether they represent i e are from the same site on homologous the assembly led to two different main for genome ing the method preferred by the human genome project is the hierarchical shot gun two step method in this approach genomic is first cut into large on average which are inserted into bac used to transform e coli where they are replicated and the map position of each bac insert is then determined because these are in a random fashion they will tend to overlap in a tiling pattern in the second step each bac is cut into smaller which are into and at this stage there is no attempt to identify the order before so the to be are selected at random shotgun ing the are by data so that identical over lap once sufficiently many times to produce high quality data the in molecular p page contiguous are into finished sequence in the alternative single step method whole genome shotgun applied by the private company the bac step is this direct approach was on otic which are smaller in size and contain less repetitive here genomic is directly randomly into small which are into and on both the are fed into and into finished sequence the genome continuously report their data to large web based data bases with user friendly where several are for each gene further outlined below identification of novel in molecular biology a gene can be defined as a region a molecule where most encode protein synthesis although the human genome been almost fully there still remain to be discovered in species where the full genome sequence is available on novel are primarily by computer analysis in two main are used the first the existence i

the corresponding gene in a different species or for a related but different homologous gene in the same species in the same species are computer pare nucleotide or protein by alignment to in the and calculate the statistical significance most commonly used are of the basic local alignment search tool blast program designed to detect similarity between alternatively the input sequence may be from genetic or even whole ge in which case all with significance are targeted with the presumption that these will be more resist ant to than non functional and hence better during evolution as an example mainly for the purpose species the chapter p page leading to and split approximately million ago the was chosen because it the vertebrate genome known less than one seventh the size human genome but with an equal ber to the human by showing high sequence between the two species more than novel human were in addition the finding i e together in the same chromosomal region during this vast amount shed light upon the evolutionary forming the two homology screening is also in based on hybridization to and with usually into bacteriophage derived these are into active which are spread thinly over

produced in and a source when is in the amount isolated from the the sam are therefore with respect to from housekeeping which ideally should be at roughly equal in the cell studied unaffected by external northern blot above is the traditional method for quantitative the with this method are that it is time consuming relatively large and can give spurious owing to cross hybridization in particular when dealing with related family the latter problem is in a method assay which full identity between sample and probe based on simplicity and sensitivity these have now largely been by based on semiquantitative and quantitative reverse chain reaction reverse transcription as part was above a first strand copy is first made a reverse together with an or a gene specific primer thereafter is with a gene specific primer pair the are by electrophoresis on and with bromide and the relative band are by visual comparison or measured by ideally the band in the different should perfectly reflect the amount of in the different there are many with this approach the near exponential amplification make it vulnerable and small in reaction between can have large effects in addition the number must be limited to avoid exhausting the but still sufficient for reliable detection product with the use to normalize for sample to sample in total and reaction efficiency it is possible to reach reasonable semiquantitative in the the method is widely used as it does not require sophisticated apparatus and is rapid se and depending on the ate choice highly specific because only the chapter p page reaction is measured the quantitative accuracy method is limited it is increasingly being by real time or quantitative these are based on the detection reporter that bind

that allow the protein to be in case it is a cytoplasmic or in molecular p page nuclear protein not normally and that contain added easy purification by affinity chromatography that contain the desired selection tag secre are either commercially available from a large number pliers or can be made in the laboratory by modification the inserted can be informative to understand the function protein the natural amino acid sequence can be very informative deletion or replacement amino acid can be carried out by inserted sequence often we want to produce only part protein for example gene a protein and the purpose is to produce membrane external part it is necessary to delete the the region and the cytoplasmic stalk moreover it can be useful to construct where different are together in a single polypeptide can be done in a cut and paste fashion restriction a convenient approach is to use to amplify the by restriction enzyme to the the product can be into the multiple site vector the purpose can be with an example let us say we are dealing with a receptor where we have that it is involved in to the cell upon bind ing but the is unknown we can then make hybrid or that consist signal region receptor to the binding part different receptor with known available the construct is into for into suitable host where the can be studied want to identify the unknown s we can make the other way round the binding together with taken from other the system is set up so that read observable cellular report when the are exposed to candidate or a few generally are not done by restriction but instead by site directed today this is done by a like method that cover the mutation site but have a different desired nucleotide sequence chapter p page gene knockdown by specific a different approach to the function protein is to look at what when it is no longer present or its expression is significantly reduced this is a knockdown experiment and is by specifically the corresponding for degradation stopping them from being previously this was done by to these are that are complementary to the we want to inhibit the method gradually been by two other more efficient with a similar aim the first which have a catalytic domain which and other the catalytic domain can be directed against specific by flanking complementary to the target can then be transiently or stably with the construct the second method is to as small interference an evolution ary defence system against viral the used for research are synthetic long double made complementary to the targeted for inactivation the bind to a induced complex which then is to and the target with properly designed this method can be very efficient and is to some degree even used in in multicellular such as the nematode and the fly drosophila melanogaster and knockout the establishment for ge manipulation ani during recent as an invaluable source for functional in with the two main popularly to as see box in the former technique a gene is transferred into the genome by the use or by microinjection at the zygote egg stage the gene is stably into the genome and will be present in all the body the germ the is therefore heritable a problem is that the gene is inserted at more or less random in the as the majority are silent in mature the chromosomal position effects are usually mani as unwanted transcriptional it is possible to shield against these effects by flanking the with insulator by suitable in molecular p page expression can be to specific cell may be from other species but usually the is copied from a gene endogenous to the animal in which case the experimental model information on what when the gene is knockout are by inactivation or more chromosomal inactivation is on embryonic stem es which are totipotent stem cell cultured in in brief a defect copy targeted gene is into the es by homologous recombination a process normally upon in for repair chromosomal the copy and the normal gene the gene construct must contain a positive selection marker selection with replacement construct most commonly used is the resist gene successful site specific are relatively rare whereas unwanted into non homologous are frequent incorrect can be screened for by or alternatively by a negative selection marker to the replacement vector the negative marker is outside the region similarity between the vector and the targeted locus the explaining the requirement for es cell which the technology to species where such cell are available the knockout technique is technically more difficult but analytical beyond the simple method identification of associated with disease single nucleotide polymorphism the previous section with a gene and at to study its function its phenotypic in here we shall look at the reverse problem starting with phenotypic between we want to identify the genetic to this variability in the perspective of general biology genetically induced in

natural or specific antibody bound to solid phase some as well as several other classical biochemical are also used for protein characterization most will not be dealt with here where we shall limit the presentation to few selected tech for protein expression analysis for identification as well as some included in what is loosely to as protein expression and in this section protein expression to the directed synthesis large amount specific protein for this purpose a sequence usually the protein is into an expression vector the vector must contain a pro moter that will be triggered in the host cell and the insert must be correctly relative to the promoter three main are used mainly e coli insect and mammalian cell and mammalian cell will be briefly here the main advantage of e coli is its simplicity in use it is easily rapidly in cheap culture media and can produce large of the desired protein the disadvantage is that the protein may not be correctly folded or many need assistance from molecular for proper folding or to inhibit premature physical contact between hydrophobic folded which may lead chapter p page to their forming insoluble to as inclusion most extra cellular whether or the external part of are normally but not in the host in some a lack is beneficial in particular when growing protein for use in x ray crystallography expression in mammalian cell can be transient usually lasting only for a couple stable or inducible to ensure proper folding and post translational the host cell should ideally be as closely related to the cell type normally the protein as possible in practice the choice cell is limited as it needs to be established as a cell line that to grow and divide in in besides many cell are notoriously difficult to two commonly used mammalian cell for protein expression are cos and t these produce constitutively large viral protein t antigen simian virus large antigen involved in viral genome replication leading to pro high expression the signal for secretion the protein to be into the culture medium by see for functional in section by the protein can be to high purity by affinity chromatography alternatively the tail can be added to the c terminus protein purification with protein g this is particularly useful protein is to be used for mice for as the mouse tail will not be immunogenic in mice protein analyses by electrophoresis western blotting and like can be by electrophoresis unlike which are uniformly negatively differ greatly in their net charge at a given this is because the side have very different some have acidic some basic while some are neutral and hydrophobic to enable separation base d on size as well as to solubilize largely hydrophobic the negatively detergent sodium dodecyl sulphate in molecular p page is added to the protein sample because relatively uniformly to most the net negative charge will be proportional to size bound are thus easily according to size by electrophoresis in poly in a process known as gel electrophoresis page detection can be done in the gel by staining staining silver staining or fluorescent visualization specific protein is commonly done by transferring the in the gel to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane a process known as western blot ting the membrane can then be exposed to specific or other that specifically bind to a particular protein one popular use blot is the identification in an antibody is added to a protein sample typically a cell lysate the antibody to the specific protein and is then coupled to a solid phase that washing away unbound binding between two are sufficiently strong new can be from the or protein sample by subsequent page and western blot analysis two dimensional electrophoresis in addition to separating according to size or more correctly molecular mass they can be based on their net charge every protein an iso electric point pi that is a at which its net charge is zero in isoelectric focus ing a protein sample is applied to a horizontal medium that an linear gradient an electric field is applied a protein with net positive charge will then migrate towards the anode while the in the medium until the net charge protein is zero and the movement conversely a negatively protein will migrate towards the cathode until the concentration it uncharged and the electrophoretic move ment is isoelectric can be useful alone but become very useful to improve the power separation in two dimensional protein electrophoresis the isoelectric is first on a strip which is then in inserted at the end gel and subjected to page with the electric field at a angle because most will have their chapter p page unique combination and molecular mass gel separation in two provided the separation technology is optimal separation single protein into a unique spot by the and two dimensional d by computer that are differentially expressed between two different cell can be single can then be directly cut out from the gel and protein protein when the function particular protein it is often desirable to other that it to and with one way such is as outlined above by western blot or protein because this approach its an alternative method two hybrid assay is sometimes preferred this can be per formed in yeast or in mammalian in brief a gene construct is made that the protein protein x coupled to a different protein e g the binding domain transcription factor a cell line is stably with this hybrid gene then a hybrid library is made where the transcription part transcription factor is coupled to all the various in the library y the cell line that already protein x is with the hybrid library library hybrid y to our protein x the joining necessary transcription in close proximity will lead to tran scription marker gene that can be easily such as green fluorescent protein or the enzyme luciferase several other similar exist which are more useful in the normal function presently known partner the term to the

some have been dealt with above in the following the presentation will focus on expression analyses mass spectrometry and in expression and protein expression in expression the goal is to catalogue the complete set in a given cell type or tissue how it is consequent to disease or medication for several this is at present an unattainable goal in lar for multicellular first even in the human there

should exhibit high power the ability to distinguish between same protein high sensitivity suitability for high throughput analysis the ability correctly to reflect relative protein in principle expression large number can be measured by in contrast to however cannot be based on sequence instead the reporter must be able specifically to recognize d for each protein the reporter most commonly used are there is consider able work behind the generation and although many are now commercially available they are expensive and sometimes difficult to produce owing to the low immunogenicity to are reporter by phage display acid in the phage display technique random expression are made so that the produced are fused with the coat protein bacteriophage vector and therefore will be displayed on the surface viral particle protein x against which reporter are to be produced is used to coat the surface plastic dish the phage display library is then added to the dish after a while the dish is washed removing non adherent isolated from attached that encode mediating binding to protein x the is then isolated and used for mass production the acid technique the folding or single just like of amino they can form complicated d with that can fit in molecular p page into complementary such as so that the are hooked together by summation weak chemical the advantage is that they can replicate them by repeated affinity chromatography to protein x by amplification bound with gradual in binding stringency for each round high affinity can be evolution selected there are other for generating reporter for pro detection but currently with very limited use the field is under intense investigation but it will take many before we have comprehensive sion for similar to mass spectrometry previously by d electrophoresis were mainly by or by degradation now the main analytical tool is mass spectrometry the protein are cut out d gel and digested with an usually trypsin which the c

medical research and introduction what is basic medical research does it differ from basic research in general can it be distinguished from translational and clinical medical research an duction to the and medical research needs to these yet no generally accepted are available in part because in research over the past have led to between and research clouding the distinction between basic medical and basic biological research moreover new and ever more powerful molecular biological genetic biochemical and morphological have the exploration and biochemical patient derived biological making the distinction between clinical and basic research less distinct for these the definition medical research in this chapter is pragmatic it is research that usually is in medical dental or veterinary or with the aim of understanding normal or pathological at the molecular cellular organic and organismic p page this definition understanding and at many the and used to reach such understanding must be effective at all the obviously must be able to ate data but since the goal is to obtain intellectual insight the data must contribute to the understanding biological and pathological logic usually this that the permit testing or more structured or hypotheses in this view gathering biological alone is seen to be worth and accordingly is given low priority also because the medical research are to gain into biological the used should be the most amenable to providing to the successful medical research are by relevant and clearly stated that prompt the use effective methodology and not the other way round and thorough knowledge experience with a method trigger research seldom leads to outstanding research chapter box basic of a research problem a clearly stated problem should permit clear description and specific all hypotheses structured should be testable the problem should be amenable to data collection and the selected should be those most efficient in testing the hypotheses box the importance of important the purpose enquiry is not to compile an inventory information nor to build up a totalitarian world picture in which every event that is not compulsory is forbidden we should think rather as a logically articulated structure about nature it as a story about a possible world a story which we invent and and modify as we go along so that it by being as nearly as we can make it a story about real life p page long term and specific significant research entail sustained effort duration science is a marathon not a sprint hence clearly stated long term should be defined at the outset box and of basic medical research the scientific method is a potentiation sense with a specially firm determination not to persist in error exertion or mind can deliver us from it like other exploratory it can be resolved into a dialogue between fact and fancy the actual and the possible between what could be true and what is in fact the case it can be said with complete confidence that any scientist age who to make important must study important dull yield dull or it is not enough that a prob should be interesting almost any problem is interesting is stud in sufficient depth a problem must be such that it what is whether to science generally or to mankind box and a vision the research to accomplish in the long run example the long term are to identify the lar responsible for the occurrence and characteristic in are the more immediate example the objective is to obtain insight into the molecular responsible for the initial rapid growth and subsequent slow involution p page the long term serve as remote daily scientific work is headed however whether their attainment is three to five in the future for a doctoral dissertation or longer to y for a junior faculty member to lish an independent laboratory or to for a professor to impact a chosen field the no matter how well defined are too distant to serve as practical for the daily weekly or monthly so specific should be to organize shorter term the serve as short term chosen so that when successfully they enable the investigator to reach specific on the way towards the long term they should be structured so that they are interrelated but not sequentially interdependent successful completion aim should not be a requisite for starting work on the next aim in fact it should be possible to work simultaneously on two or three specific also should be defined so that the specific on one aim do not make work on another aim intractable for example in a project on the genetic cutaneous benign that grow rapidly for a few and after birth and then slowly regress over the next few box it would be wrong to plan the generation gene knockout model in mice following to identify gene that are responsible for formation box if gene are responsible for analogous to genetic responsible for other generating a mouse knockout model would make sense only are by loss of function the implicitly prescribe effective experimental for their ment and detailed should logically result from the specific chapter specific serve as practical for daily weekly and monthly research example aim screen for genetic loci in familial by linkage and loss of y analyses aim screen for candidate gene in sporadic p page and of basic medical research box rapid growth and slow involution of infantile from al at birth p page and not be chosen only because the investigator how to perform them for these are best in that both imply hypotheses to be tested as well as the to test them without being overly and method for example for the research on the molecular responsible for the initial rapid growth and subsequent slow involution the statement screen for genetic loci in familial by linkage and loss of heterozygosity is a better description aim than sequence x y z with from with box although the work to be done ultimately the first statement the hypotheses that engender in some and therefore can be and that second hit somatic detectable as loss of heterozygosity ma y be present in the statement also the technical approach for the hypotheses namely linkage and loss of heterozygosity analysis the description specific aim around a testable hypothesis works well when are tested in more descriptive it may be better to state the specific in series for example research were on the natural history rather than the molecular responsible for their formation one may ask what is the typic variability among with sporadic and familial a hypothesis driven aim is not necessarily superior to just different from a descriptive aim but it to be clear concerning the category as different lead to different hypothesis driven can lead to mechanistic descriptive can lead to new hypotheses for subsequent testing hypothesis driven research is seen as the gold standard research and many and editorial will not consider anything else for publication in their nonetheless descriptive undoubtedly will continue to be for example the natural history is essential to the effects and descriptive analyses expression during development and growth are essential to the understanding tissue specific effects and that are designed to interfere with gene action chapter p page what is a reasonable time period that a specific aim might cover this on the overall scope project for three year research funded by the national in the or in many it is not uncommon to have three each covering a year for that are funded by one year it may be advantageous that each shorter three to four background and significance in a good research project each long term goal and each specific aim should address a significant need for better understanding area identification a need should be based on a comprehensive in depth analysis contemporary understanding as reflected in the literature this preparatory phase research project is often glossed over and until the experimental phase is and a manuscript is about to be written all too often are triggered by reading in a hot area are exciting and lead to some obvious next to be some one with befitting may plunge into the work this approach to a research project the work define what is to be done next ally does not generate sustained research at a high level and originality one reason is that exciting paper ens up obvious and important it is likely that the paper have already extended the work to those by the time the paper in press therefore any study that is by upon reading the paper is probably too little too late another rea son is that that upon first reading seem to break new ground often turn out to be less important in the light work and more careful analyses research based solely on the for their should also be ample is essential for sustained research but it is wrongheaded to let the research area the long term and the specific be shaped by for grant in specific at best or are decided by or at worst by governmental based on that may be unrelated to scientific needs in advance a research project think about its significant what is scholarly intriguing what are less well and therefore and of basic medical research p page what have noteworthy biological and medical and so on a rewarding research project by pondering its background and significance and indeed a statement with just that title usually is in for to aside a description background and significance project is a useful guide even work is already funded and no grant application is box chapter box to keep in mind during the literature review for a research project do not limit the review to that are available only go back significant in anatomy histology and physiology were made that long ago put your and concerning the rationale for doing the research and the for select ing specific in writing even are not a grant application think broadly avoid a project so that it principally is a follow up in a paper by elsewhere in reading the background literature be strategic read with the purpose of the that will contribute to the logical foundation the rationale for the research this a study a quick reading is insufficient another pitfall to be is the practice the literature review to accessible in remember that the greater part body research past work done before ubiquitous and information technology such as and available older works in the background reading to vent the awkward have or more ago when the overall rationale for a research project been resolved its is apparent so then it is time to define specific which are the mental that most readily will advance understanding in the chosen area of research in the context available the experience the past by the investigator and the state art in the field p page experimental and the experimental for the hypotheses and research project are crucial to its ultimate success inadequate can spoil a project with an unsurpassed hypothesis innovative can enhance a relatively insignificant project and lead it to many are most comfortable with they know well and tend to use them even though they may be inadequate to avoid this de sac think about experimental as broadly as possible seek expert advice on learn new as necessary or collaborate with other as above all be open to new and technically and remember that with enough time and effort any technique can be learned and effectively applied the experimental should include to the that may be used should the come out as as well as when they differ from any significant finding should be in different ways by different likewise the failure experimental technique should be by comparison with other pilot scientific research might be said to be the pursuit this is particularly true in the medical and biological in which and usually are not known exactly at the outset consequently a research study may have many due to its size its nature or both so often a study is by a pilot study which is a miniature version full scale study that to assess its and warn for example in the project at the molecular responsible for the formation of sporadic infantile cutaneous see box it was clear that the consist with rapidly endothelial plus and other stromal box but the may be to a primary defect in endothelial or may be a response to an abnormality in stromal or in in the overlying skin as these two underlying each would dictate a course and of basic medical research p page a pilot study was to determine the primary driver abnormal angiogenesis al it to find whether the primary lesion in within the endothelial through testing the hypothesis that are by somatic in that regulate endothelial cell behaviour their proliferation the hypothesis that all endothelial within are derived from a single abnormal cell therefore in all endothelial should carry the same x chromosome maternal or paternal to determine whether this is the case were isolated from and endothelial were from other with a magnetic bead procedure box a polymorphism variable length cag repeat sequence within the androgen receptor gene on the x chromosome to distinguish between the mater and paternal x chromosome and cleavage with a methylation sensitive restriction enzyme to distinguish between active and inactive x it was that endothelial in sporadic are indeed clonal in contrast stromal from within the were not clonal that provided strong evidence for a primary defect in endothelial and defined a specific strategic direction for the project and a rationale for chapter box the of anti staining h e p page specific with the objective the nature endothelial cell abnormality as this example pilot must be as rigorously as full scale indeed a pilot study the foundation on which a full scale study and consequently should be just as complete and reliable with proper positive and negative for basic medical research at the beginning chapter a pragmatic definition medical research was given as research with the aim understanding mental normal or pathological at the molecular cellular organic and organismic this definition can accommodate research on a variety of a wide range box specific advice on research across this broad spectrum is beyond the scope chapter however at the start research project a few box may be kept in mind and of basic medical research box the primary defect in an abnormality intrinsic to endothelial by somatic if are yes and yes the prediction is that are clonal of abnormal endothelial magnetic endothelial unbound p page the first and second five in box

variable to calculate the number to be included for most the number included is decided in advance that leads to a fixed sample design intended number is large data may be one or more times in the course trial on the effect treatment can be drawn early on new need not be included such analyses before the intended number is included are interim analyses and require the use statistical ber intended is not set in advance and data are continuously such as each time a response for a patient is the trial is sequential the effect new treatment is assessed through it with the effect of the standard treatment there are two principal study in a parallel group study one group a new treatment and another group a standard treatment the effects are between the two independent in a cross over study all receive both but in different during the study only the order among the the then are their own which random variation accordingly cross over require than do parallel group nonetheless cross over are less frequently used in part because their applicability is lim to that are chronic and stable moreover there may be a carry over effect effect with one medication chapter p page clinical research into the next treatment period in both parallel group and cross over more than two may be in a parallel group study the comparison is known as between while in a cross over study the comparison is within individual the within individual comparison the advantage that the variation for an individual patient over time usually is less than that between different cross over are less well to long duration treatment as with increasing time there is increasing risk withdrawing from the study as cross over ally involve few the relative loss when a patient leaves the study is greater than in a parallel group study a number in addition to being used for with different ran clinical are used to compare a medicinal treatment with other and to compare other such as different surgical these trial bring new and and often it is difficult or to conduct a blinded study other include various hospital based with home based as well as prevention e g vaccination and screening historical it is not unusual to try to conduct a study without a control group the son then is between a new treatment and who received a standard treatment the previously are historical historical is tempting but the is fair comparison two differ in other ways than the it is difficult to say whether a seemingly better outcome in the group the new treat ment is due only to that treatment may be in the patient selection or systematic in surroundings over time and may tend to exaggerate the effect new treatment as a rule a historical control group is not subjected to inclusion and exclusion criteria whereas the inclusion in a group a new treatment is far more restrictive it is also possible that the current are different p page chapter type than those a while ago another problem is that the quality of recording treatment effect for the historical may be substantially lower as they were originally not part trial retrospective collection seldom can overcome the problem moreover as a rule the criteria for response may change with time accordingly historical should be used as little as possible historical might provide a basis for the generation but should not be used in reaching concerning an effect comparison is by random allocation to or to sequence in cross over the purpose is to prevent systematic between the treatment simple randomization is equivalent to tossing a coin but usually ran dom number tables are on a computer in order to allocate randomly to the trial selection bias may be by patient consent to take part in the trial before randomization the most common randomization is o ne to one that is approximately equal in both however in and occasionally more may be included in the new treat ment group as the new treatment is the less well known likewise in a placebo group the may be numerically unequal because one to receive placebo simple randomization does not necessarily result in the being equally distributed in age gender and other that may be significant but any will be due to chance and not to systematic selection to different stratified ion may be used when more closely similar are randomization patient balanced for prognostic it is most often done in first a few important prognostic are for example in a breast cancer study the can be p page receptor positive or negative and size t or t stratification based on these two each two in four strata or within each stratum are in let the two be a and b a customary block size is four for which there are six sequence enrolment abba baba this that after every fourth patient is enrolled two will have received treatment a and two will have received treat ment b hence balance is between a and b an example of block randomization in four strata in a breast cancer study is shown in table clinical research table within strata unfortunately when the experimenter the block size in a trial that is not blinded below it may be possible to anticipate the given to some in any event that is obvious for the last patient enrolled in each block hence the experimenter may know which treatment a new p page chapter patient will receive such knowledge may consciously or unconsciously affect the decision a particular patient should be included in the trial the result may be selection bias lessen that problem but there is also a greater risk in a stratum in which few are enrolled stratification with a large number should be the number increase rapidly with an increasing number of for example a third prognostic factor in the breast cancer study example above such as number lymph grouped in three and will increase the number from four to a difficulty with a large number is that some strata may have very few or none at all which down the entire concept of balance between stratified randomization can be resource demanding as a rule stratification is considered unnecessary in because full randomization is to provide good balance with a large number moreover stratification should be prognostic significance particular factor is uncertain into treatment does not ensure unbiased comparison systematic bias may arise whenever a physician which patient received which treatment particularly when response is subjectively knowing the treatment a patient may lead to the physician s or the patient s confidence in the treatment con or unconsciously affecting the evaluation effect ideally all should be double blind so that neither the patient nor the treating physician the treatment given standard treatment is non existent or largely ineffective as often is the case for cancer both the patient and the physician ma y be overly optimistic about the effects new treatment consequently knowledge treatment given can influence a patient s response re is no standard treatment the in one group may be given a placebo which is an inactive substance the same appearance and preferably the same smell and taste as the active drug p page blinding clinical is sometimes difficult such as in clinical cancer research in which few blinded are actually run this may be because a treatment is so toxic that it is essential to know when it is given to a patient or it may be because differ considerably assume for instance that treatment a is two taken twice daily and that treatment b is one capsule three times a day this difficulty may be overcome by a double dummy technique in which one patient will be given the active treatment a and for b while another will be given active treatment b and for a each patient six and three daily but only the or the contain the active drug depending on whether the patient is to treatment a or b this procedure is straightforward for oral treatment with few or but can be difficult or possibly ethically unacceptable medication to be sometimes a treatment specific side e that clearly reveal its use even though the research plan is double blind that are not blinded or in which the code is broken can be subject to bias both in patient and in evaluation effect treatment bias in can be by one investigator administer treatment and another evaluate patient which should be included in the statistical analysis it is desirable to record as much relevant information as possible on all enrolled in a clinical trial but in practice much information may be at the end trial some may have out trial some may have taken excessive or insufficient medication studied or some may have completely from taking the medication they were random to receive in some it may be necessary to stop treating a patient such as when adverse occur it is vital to take a decision on the to be included in the statistical analysis before the effects treatment there is no set criterion con which should be included in an analysis but for handling insufficient data should be made in advance and preferably be in the protocol lest systematic error may arise due to the lack plan for instance clinical research p page chapter the statistical analysis may overestimate treatment effect does not include who withdraw from treatment owing to lack for which shall be included in statistical roughly in two a per protocol analysis only compliant who take a dose such as and who the inclusion and exclusion criteria protocol such an analysis may be used to estimate the true effect treatment in real life many do not take so an intention to treat analysis all regardless or not they have taken the treatment this can be as a pragmatic approach that rather than in treatment effect regarding the effect treatment often are drawn from a form to treat analysis choice of or just a few efficacy or should be chosen to evaluate a treatment effect the study with many efficacy may be cult to interpret nonetheless data on many relevant are often col and efficacy could be assessed in different ways with different in such it is wise at the stage to distinguish between primary and secondary efficacy typically a study will have one primary and two or more secondary the recording standardized reliable valid clinical laboratory clinical recording and or the filling in in any event reproducibility and must be acceptable the standardization method also familiarity with that can affect its stability and area multiple most clinical effects are measured in various ways for example the outcome cancer treatment may be expressed as overall survival cancer specific survival progression free survival response according to specific criteria toxicity or quality p page clinical research analyses large number can be problematic because separate analyses at the level will increase the probability positive with a significance level of one out of will be to show a difference even when the are equally good or equally poor the more the greater the probability that one or more will by chance have a low p value the correction is one way the probability positive each p value by the number to be and the p are at the level if for instance four are and a total level of is sought each calculated p value is by four instead one may divide the total significance level by the number and use the quotient for each test that is for four compare each p value with the level a disadvantage correction is that it is conservative it over slightly particularly when the various are correlated a better strategy may be to reduce the number or predefine one or two mary it can be tempting to se retrospectively for which the statistical analyses have given low p but that is cheating as it in overestimation difference in treatment effects instead a single primary several may be combined in a composite or joint variable such as in of the quality that said it may be problematic to define a clinically mean composite or joint variable so care must be in the analytical subgroup analyses it is natural to ask whether an difference between two on particular patient such as gender age or another prognostic factor a commonplace though unsuitable way that question is to divide the into that are separately one analysis is that many may be defined and accordingly many p calculated which the risk of false positive conversely as are often small relatively large real effect may go undetected because the power probability of p page chapter revealing is too low see section for various may be useful but the presentation should be ancillary to sons based on all the and the accordingly cautiously in any event subgroup analyses should be in advance separate significance do not answer the question as to whether a given prognostic factor the treatment effect instead one should perform a test for interaction that is a significance test that whether there is a differ between treatment effects in different this can be done by an interaction term in a statistical model such as multiple regression analysis a typical result such a term may be that treatment a a better effect than treatment b and that the difference is greater for than for men interim analyses many clinical are over several enough may take a long time and in some must be for several before the effect treatment can be an example is clinical cancer research which is primarily concerned with the effects on survival in such it could be valuable to conduct one or more interim analyses on the effects treatment before the number of have been included in the study difference between the effects of is early on it is desirable from an ethics point as well as financially sensible to stop the trial thus will be included in the group the treatment effect and an start may be made in making the best treatment available to all interim analyses should be made only when in advance to see why this is so consider a study with in each with analysis until have been from all then assume that it longer to include than initially assumed after data from have been acquired it is tempting to analyse the to date significant difference then can be shown between the it is tempting to conclude that one treatment is superior to the other if however no significant difference is shown the study will continue to enrol hence p page clinical research there may be several to identify between the treat test is at the level the total probability false positive finding the null hypothesis even is true will be considerably greater than the sought the probability positive find with repeated testing data as shown in table in the example of a hypothesis test is after data are avail able on the first say and the test is stopped significant difference is found at the level but continued with the enrolment of new cant difference is found that scenario may be repeated until data have been acquired from so there may be up to five with that strategy the total probability a difference even though none will be not as initially table probability positive finding the total significance in table are based on that follow a normal distribution with known variance but other pro similar the drawback probability positive may be by reducing the nominal level for each interim analysis the maximum number is set before the trial interim analyses are usually per formed at set either in time or in enrolled interim analyses are often group a simple group sequential method that that the total level is been by here the level for each analysis is reduced as shown in table maximum of five analyses is to be each individual interim analysis must have a sig at the level in order that the trial may be stopped with a declared p page chapter table nominal level in interim analysis with a total significance level of difference a total significance level of there are several group sequential and pure sequential me in which an analysis is for each patient response the pure sequential method from most group sequential in that the trial may be stopped early not only significant difference is but also may be that there hardly is any difference in the effects the disadvantage method is that it somewhat power in practice other stopping o fleming are more often used they differ from the method in that the nominal significance level between the interim analyses the level for the first analysis is chosen to be very low while that for the last analysis is nearly the advantage method is that power is not lost and that there is no need to include more than would have been the case had the trial been with a fixed sample size that is without interim analyses o fleming stop are also listed in table p page publication bias statistical significance is often as conclusive two have different effects regrettably that line often leads to erroneous in there is a trend for to include significant but not mention insignificant such may be deliberate but most often occur because the author is not aware inherent bias moreover showing statistically significant are more frequently than with a non significant outcome that the situation in add journal and tend to give more weight to significant were all one might easily suspect that rare divergent positive were due to chance in the real world for every paper significant there might be other that no difference between which remain unpublished this leads to the assumption that the are real and in turn to drawing erroneous on efficacy it is likely that a worrisomely large portion in the medical literature actually false positive sample size power before an experimental or observational study it is essential to estimate how many or people need be enrolled to reach valid on an effect the first question to be is how large the difference in the effects must be to have clinical relevance as in table one may occur in a hypothesis test two d are desirable while two band c result in erroneous the that may occur are the null hypothesis even though it is true b or it when it is false c often type i error clinical research table possible hypothesis test h accepted ach p page chapter and type error respectively the aim should be to keep the of these small the upper limit to the probability that occur p b is the significance level trial which as a rule is set at likewise often p c the power is the probability a certain treat ment effect it is p d and is the probability the null hypothesis when it in fact is false this probability should be high and in a trial it is usually set to or the first step in a trial is to select the significance level and power relevant to the least observable difference considered clinically relevant then the number to be enrolled is determined and the trial is finally statistical analyses are on the data the smaller the difference sought the greater the number to be enrolled in the trial unless a trial is large small have low power and even clinically interesting effects run considerable risk unseen the con that two have equal efficacy cannot automatically be drawn even though the null hypothesis is not as perhaps there were too few to detect a difference only when the power is high can the claim be made that not the null hypothesis to there being no differ in the treatment effects binomial response assume that a standard treatment sur vive for five and a trial is set up to determine whether a new treatment can increase the survival rate to see box to calculate sample size box sample size binomial response a simple and useful equation for calculating sample size is in each group the constant on the choice level and power probability a certain difference between two p page clinical research relevant of various significance and power are given in table table constant c assume that in the example above we choose a significance level of and a power of accordingly in each group it is necessary to enrol continuous response of assume that a cross over study is in which all receive two in order let be the difference in treatment effect sought and standard deviation difference between the two treatment effects it may be difficult to make a valid assumption on variability before the trial is done but or a pilot study may provide an estimate sample size is calculated as shown in box n box sample size continuous response of the number to be enrolled is where of care listed in table p page chapter assume that a cross over study asthma is the peak expiratory flow rate in per minute is the primary efficacy variable a clinically relevant difference in effect is set at l min and we assume that d l min the significance level is set at and the power at this c so the study must enrol two independent parallel n box sample size continuous response parallel when two independent are to be the number of each group is where as before is the clinically relevant difference sought a constant that on the significance level and power and is the standard deviation assumed equal for the two as a rule considerably more are in a parallel group study than in a cross over study assume that a parallel study asthma is similar to the cross over study above a clinically relevant difference in is assumed to be l min while the standard deviation is assumed to be l min the standard deviation is than in the cross over example because the parallel study individual data from different in the two whereas the cross over study used within patient as it is reasonable to assume that on a single patient are p page positively correlated dis usually less than the number to be enrolled then is in each group that is in all unequal group size most often randomization is so the two are same size however in some unequal randomization is desirable so the two are sizes one such case may be when a trial a placebo group that is kept small to minimize the number given inactive treatment another case is when more extensive experience is sought with a new drug so a number will receive it for a set total number randomization always the high power as shown in table randomization is the loss of power is small for greater in the in the two it may be wise to increase slightly the total number enrolled n clinical research table loss with unequal sample size first calculated as were size then a sam size calculated assume that the ratio between the in each two the total number to be enrolled then is p page chapter and the sample sizes in each two are for instance in a ratio of leads to a number sample size based on precision of instead computation sample size on the power sought the problem may be in precision in an estimate the question then is for example how wide shall the confidence interval of an estimate be accepted to be or in other how imprecise an estimate will we accept binomial response and box precision of the estimate of a binomial confidence interval binomial p is the proportion n the total number and se p p p n let the interval length be d that is the confidence interval is p d the number p page the magnitude sought p is unknown to estimate the number necessary we must either reckon a reasonable value of set it p which is conservative and in the possible value of a given interval length because the product p p is maximum the product is lower for all other of p if be in advance it is reasonable to use p in n if however to be relatively small such as p is more suitable in calculating n this type is the basis the number to be in a political opinion poll and is also often used for phase example assume that we wish to know the proportion whose first choice in treating sinusitis is to prescribe penicillin we intend to send out a questionnaire and accordingly need an estimate many general should be first we must stipulate a precision estimate in other how wide the confidence interval proportion is accepted to be assume an interval length of that is d and set p magnitude proportion is unknown we then estimate that general should be included in the study continuous response the confidence interval for the true mean is where x is the mean standard deviation number of and relevant fractile in the t distribution for practical pur t is often with z and this approximation when n n clinical research p page chapter regrettably in practice is unknown and must be for instance from exist non inferiority the above text clinical that seek to document the superiority of one particular treatment to another that is often the case but an increasingly greater part to show that a new treatment is not inferior to a standard treatment this aim is a consequence on approval according to european legislation on medicinal it is sufficient to document that a new product an effect not worse than the product already and that its benefit risk ratio is acceptable in that a new drug is not inferior to one already on the market it is not sufficient to demonstrate that the p value for a comparison is not statistically significant i e p a high p be due to the two being approximately equally good but it also may be due to a type error which to not an actual treat ment difference even the risk error with the number included in a trial in a trial aiming to show that the effect treatment is superior to that of another the null hypothesis would be that the effects two do box precision of an estimate of the true mean the number necessary to attain the precision of an estimate true mean is where as before dis the confidence interval and is deviation p page clinical research not differ the alternative hypothesis would be that the effects differ and are almost always two sided in general the null hypothesis is the one that the trial to reject box when the aim is to demonstrate the equivalence the null hypothesis is that their effects are unequal that can be by the following example box hypotheses null hypothesis the hypothesis that one to refute superiority a and b are equally effective ha a and b are not equally effective here the alternative hypothesis h two sided a could be superior to b or b could be superior to a non inferiority study h treatment a is inferior to treatment b ha treatment a is as good as or better than treatment b here the alternative hypothesis h one sided all that we need to know is that treatment a is not inferior to the standard treatment b but what does not inferior to really mean two different or treatment rarely have identical efficacy and even had so would be impossible without a huge study oftens in each group therefore in practice one how large the efficacy difference may be for the two to be as equally effective and thereafter a trial is to show that the difference in treatment effects is too small to be clinically relevant this maximum difference usually is p page chapter agreeing on an acceptable value of is not easy a fixed limit cannot be set because the choice will depend on the relationship between efficacy and safety and also the two however all agree that two can be said to have similar efficacy when the difference between their effects is considerably less than the difference between the effects standard treatment and placebo even though a non inferiority trial actually against a one sided hypothesis in practice are usually made based on a two sided confidence interval but deal only with the lower limit interval this is equivalent to a one sided test at the level various in non inferiority are in figure treatment better figure four of assessment of non inferiority a confidence interval for the difference study a a significant difference in the effects the lower end confidence interval effect difference is greater than study b non inferiority the lower end confidence interval is less than so there is no significant difference between the two more over the lower limit confidence interval is greater than so the plausible difference between the two is less than the difference defined as the minimum difference relevance study c no sig difference between the two but nonetheless does not p page demonstrate non inferiority because the confidence interval the difference between the two may then be than that accepted for equivalence moreover the point estimate is on the negative side i e the result that the new treatment efficacy inferior to that standard treat ment study d the same point estimate effect difference as does study c but nonetheless a paradoxical result the new treatment is as non inferior because the confidence interval does not include but at the same time the new treatment is statistically significantly inferior to the standard treatment upper limit confidence interval here the effect difference must be against the two such as safety in addition to the consequence that a patient may receive inferior treatment for life threatening it is obviously more difficult to accept a treatment that is almost as good as a standard treatment even though it may be less expensive the difference between c and d is that study d had probably enrolled more and therefore gave a more precise estimate effect difference generalization the great advantage clinical over epidemiological is that randomization and blinding avoid an association between treatment and external that may influence the study confounding therefore it is possible to draw on direct causal between an intervention and an effect and this is why clinical are often said to have high internal validity however a drawback clinical is that they have low external validity which that the study cannot necessarily be general clinical often employ strict criteria for with regard to age other illness than that studied and intake hence the trial group a selected part population that will receive the treatment and it is not obvious that a result based on a sample is representative for the entire population concerned various of patient selection are in figure clinical research p page chapter whenever only a small percentage relevant is included or large percentage who the inclusion or exclusion criteria is not enrolled in the study there may be cause to question the study some do not want to be and in other the treating physician may decide that a patient be given a specific treat ment all such can lead to selection bias and

as an increase in occurrence to its normal rate in a particular population traditionally epidemic applied to contagious but today any condition that elevated occurrence may be an epidemic there is no set rule as to how many must occur before being declared an epidemic but any increase relative to a comparable lation may be epidemic the word is a composite of and demos which mean on or upon or over

administrative aim such as the p page occurrence in a population as precisely as possible or be at population and sample for epidemiological a population may be considered as all with measurable or the observation may be human or any other unit that we define and describe the population may be seen as an immensity as well as a dynamic and a study is always based on a sample the sample the opportunity to examine a factor that we seek to describe statistics provide us with the to draw and population based on the study sample the to be measured or registered in a sample are the to be measured determine the that may be drawn a summary from a sample is a descriptive statistic that is the mean value that something about the true and unknown mean population it is intuitively obvious that the the sample the more accurately a sample mean a value for a population the sample and the accuracy measurement determine the confidence with which we can say something about the phenomenon under study the for sample size are in section these are the same for epidemiological as for clinical from the same population provide a number that are likely to differ from sample to sample it is obvious that all these represent the true mean for the population but no one is fully correct the vari possible is the standard error mean which is equal to the sample standard deviation s divided by the square root number n the confidence interval is an estimate confidence that we have in the mean value sample with a certain probability it the highest and and p page that the true value population may have the confidence interval around an unknown mean value is x x assuming that the follow a normal distribution see section of disease occurrence association risk and the concept is often used in the association between a certain factor and the probability for later disease or harm to express a certain factor in risk factor the population studied is divided into two or more such as those who are exposed and those who are not exposed or by grading actual exposure the importance factor may be assessed when we know how many exposed and how many non e actually are ill or ill during a certain period this us to estimate the risk associated with the exposure for the factor the occurrence disease and the exposure to a potential risk factor may be in a table such as table this sort of table is a contingency table because it between the data in it chapter table association between exposure and disease healthy aba is a contingency table because it two and two this table is similar to table and estimation epidemiological provided that a suitable and valid study design been used see also chapter the of affected among the exposed d and the non exposed c provide about the occurrence according to exposure these provide the basis for the disease risk the ratio risk among p page the exposed to the non exposed is a measure association the direction of the association that is whether the factor or the risk is by the ratio being greater or less than one epidemiological measure can be classified in three disease occurrence association or effect or implication occurrence are used in causal and in descriptive analyses evolution occurrence or mortality over time effect or yield the strength association between the such as between a disease and the possible cause such are based on between disease in with various to a certain factor the measure is expressed as the risk or the probability for an event during a certain time period an example could be a study in which we are

breast cancer we might ask how many can actually be to the use the epidemiological are listed in box and further in section epidemiology and box of different epidemiological disease importance incidence relative risk excess risk prevalence odds ratio attributable risk incidence rate ratio regression coefficient p page epidemiology is about and time risk assessment is based on a central concept is the assessment or prevalence and all are prevalence or a proportion is the quotient number in the numerator to the number who are at risk in the denominator a proportion is dimensionless and from near zero to one and consequently often is expressed as a per centage up to a rate the change quantity relative to the change quantity often time an example is the speed car at an instant in time expressed as the distance covered divided by time h a rate always a derived dimension and thereby may assume a wide range for the present constant or average are more practical and will be used in the rest chapter the rate is the ratio number in the numerator and the total length up time observation time in the denominator a denominator may for example be the number over a certain period the follow up time may be for a group or for the population in the study for instance annual mortality is the rate for a time period year based on the number who die during that year the follow up time is by the sum time lived through that year for all the in the population for each individual who time is from the beginning year until the date the total follow up time is the denominator the average population or mid year population is often used in the number the error induced is min valid from depend on the same criteria for disease or cause and on the included being similar in age and gender the are based on the harmful effects or the same diagnostic criteria must be applied to all the in order to include them in the numerator quotient the ratio between risk for disease among those exposed and those not exposed to a factor a measure association between a possible causal factor for disease and the disease it can be as the ratio between or for example the risk from a coronary heart disease chapter p page during a year period for to non the ratio between the in the two is a measure risk for disease therefore often assess the gravity particular exposure however the diagnoses or must be independent exposure this independence between exposure assessment and ascertainment is prerequisite to drawing concerning possible between causal and disease or injury of disease occurrence incidence prevalence and duration there are several for disease and their occurrence in the population of which three are interest number or injured people the size population the duration condition the incidence are used to explore why and vary between in the population the incidence is defined as the number affected in a certain population during a defined period and the incidence rate is the number divided by the total observation time during the period at any one time the proportion population ill with a defined disorder the prevalence for example in norway each year about people are infected with the incidence rate for infection can be expressed as the number of per year per person year per person day the numerator incidence rate is the total number the total length up time for the whole population is the denominator so the dimension is per year or per person per day we assume that the population remains constant over the period save for the few with the disease under study epidemiology and p page the size population will for all practical be reasonably stable and the average population can be used as a denominator incidence for or can be from cohort follow up time may be difficult to estimate because the time interval to the end point for an individual group be it death emigration or another reason for ending observation often is not known the difficulty is overcome by making the time interval a variable that is a variable that is only under the specific condition being the included in the survey from start to end have the whole study period as their follow up time the sum individual follow up times is the total observation time incidence assessment that we know how many people are taken ill in a population but this sort is often and we may only have access to the number or to the n umber who die from a lar disorder this that we cannot estimate the incidence rate but must rely on mortality mortality can be upon as incidence for death the total for from all is usually expressed as the number per people per year mortality can be expressed as cause specific or broken down by age gender and occupation depending on the studied the duration disorder will together with the incidence rate determine how large a proportion population is affected by the disorder at any time that is the prevalence short duration decreasing prevalence increasing is seen when the duration disorder even when incidence are constant disease prevalence for two obvious may die or they are it does not matter h operate as both affect the duration disease and thereby its prevalence there are two measure of prevalence point prevalence which is the probability for an individual to be ill in a population at a time t and period prevalence which is an expression prob ability that an individual will ever have been ill during a defined period this is often used as a substitute for risk when the time for start disease is not known any measure reducing the fatality disorder but not health will imply that the prevalence disorder is increasing in which case pressure on the health service is unavoidable correspondingly if the fatality the prevalence will decrease chapter p page vital statistics the importance of vital statistics in an epidemiological setting vital statistics comprise systematic registration regarding single in a population with regard to birth death marriage divorce area and moving residence these data were originally col for administrative seldom with epidemiological in mind today it is also reasonable to include other in the vital statistics such as census data and disease and accident the main in epidemiology are listed in box epidemiology and box vital statistics are used for three main description population mortality comparison and gender specific death during a time period description and comparison specific age and gender specific death for different in the population vital statistical data may be combined with other information about a lation to provide the bases for ecological ecological involve data and are not based on information about each single individual in the population this that we can estimate the occurrence of disease in a group and assess it against data exposure vari which may provide and enable the development ecological have also been designed as observation but the term is also applied to other ecological are often based on vital statistics that are readily and inexpensively available an ecological study is the first study before starting specific for testing hypothesis often ask whether more than one factor will change an s risk for disease or injury vital statistics contain information on the and consequently partly on disease so they may be used as a register for in an epidemiological study linking vital statistics data to a data file information on individual and social p page and possibly also genetic prop the basis for a follow up cohort study this may be the most important use statistics in day epidemiological research mortality mortality are analogous to incidence but the event here is death instead three statistics are a death due to disease x b death but with disease x c death without x total death or all cause death in a population during a certain period the sum b and c mortality can be in two ways either as a death rate or as a death risk the probability during a certain period the way it is expressed on what we are actually mortality under a b or c the mortality rate associated with disease x can refer both to those who die from dis order a and to those with disorder b it often is impossible to distinguish between a and b in a sample another measure is disease lethality or fatality rate this is the mortality rate in a group that how many die from a certain disorder among those who have that disorder during a certain period other in a country are infant mortality and peri natal mortality which are often used as for living quality of the system and mother and child care infant mortality is the number among under the age year per live during the same period mortality is the number and during the first week after birth per born stillborn in the same period are the number per born the dead during the same period the first year is usually divided into different most often under under one week chapter p page under four the period with neonatal four to less than one year cause of death bases for the statistics on the are data in death for example the norwegian death certificate two for the cause of death part i for the main cause or the underlying cause and part for other con towards death but not the direct cause in the part for the main cause all leading to death are meant to be as the intention is to identify the cause that the disease process death are handled in different ways in different however the cation been internationally standardized the origin present day system from the s and the first edition the international list was adopted by the international statistical institute in the current international classification was adopted by the world health organization who in the classification system been revised a number and the current system is edition the number the in medicine and consequently in the classification and with regard to pathogenesis and morphology how much risk from coronary heart disease should be to the fact that a person had diabetes for many it may be reasonable to put diabetes as the condition leading to myocardial infarction taking into account the considerable risk induced by however as the mechanism for risk is not fully clear diabetes will be in part death certificate for a more detailed with regard to registration and classification see the current edition international classification of who morbidity register a register more than it permanent for all all are up in statistical epidemiology and p page frequency and survival various disease are around the world the most common are inpatient cancer and birth and some aim at chronic such as tuberculosis a full description is beyond the scope book but is available on the who at who en morbidity or mortality mortality is a good indicator occurrence provided fatality is high when the majority with a disorder die in a short time mortality the incidence disease this is not always the case and fatality may change over time and may well vary between morbidity are therefore the obvious choice development in the population is to be however permanent morbidity are large and costly the value usually becomes apparent with time when have become evident and may be the standard registration and the validity of the information collected must be consistent with time and consequently under permanent control this is one why there are relatively few disease operating on a global basis the establishment register of chronic only to support incidence may not be a rationale for these one can however see the establishment as useful for particular population as part follow up after and study of epidemiological the possibility being an association between a certain factor and a disease or health damage usually comes from clinical or case where a number with the same disorder seem to have been exposed to the same case are detailed disease they usually comprise small and often concern rare they permit rare to be and thereby offer into their chapter p page occurrence prognosis and treatment case however give limited insight with regard to there are certain where one may draw regarding as they are so obvious such as work or other similar for other the association causal relationship is far less clear a healthy group is to assess whether an affected group from healthy people with regard to more than the disease in the study in principle there are three main study that aim at box table and box and a overview with their epidemiological note that different give different epidemiological one way to describe these is to place the observer in the present time that may have in the past case control retrospective towards the present cross sectional or looking forward into the future cohort longitudinal or prospective this given rise to a number of conflicting and design hence there may be cohort that are retrospective in the sense that their data have been collected in the past or there may be case control in which the data and have been collected with a future perspective in mind epidemiology and box principal between case control cross sectional and cohort case with affected all with healthy no yes yes no risk relative risk odds odds incidence rate ratio p page case control design and structure the classic approach to disease been to compare with a corresponding healthy control group in a case control study these compare a number in the two to determine how they differ in regard to a number the for such to give meaningful are that the control are among healthy who would have been included as had become ill therefore the ideal requirement for a control group is that its should belong to the same population as the case control are retrospective looking back in time they attempt to elicit past before they clinically ill the main advantage control is that they are relatively simple to carry out moreover they are inexpensive reasonably rapid and to they permit examining large risk they also may be organized as whereby a number can participate with and the major disadvantage case control study is the inverse direction data on exposure which is collected after the patient become a case the fact that someone become sick may affect both the to as well as biological which may be among both and control the observer the examiner or the researcher will be well aware problem or the research question and thereby also know who among study belong to the and who belong to the control group thus the examiner may also be more thorough and assess the differently from the control or those affected may give that are by their being affected there are myriad possible for systematic error in case control that may affect study outcome systematic error or that affect in a chapter p page certain direction are bias thus the inverse time aspect is a major problem in the or case control classical include the relationship between stress and myocardial infarction or the use during pregnancy and the risk mal a person who just myocardial infarction and who is being about stressful immediately before the infarction may give completely different from a person in the control group chosen for another reason such as had a skiing accident the affected will search for affliction and may give by these with congenital will scrutinize their past with regard to the use during pregnancy whereas with healthy will be less prone to do so hence systematic error or recall bias to avoid these one must establish exam that reduce the possibility disease affecting the one practical in case control is selection of control the following three involve direct contact by mail or telephone in the same residential area as the patient are inviting them to take part in the control group themselves contact or in the same age group a random sample population based on census is ing background that also are available for the drawn from the same cohort with other diagnoses from the same hospital as the original are to take part as control to choose a patient from one s own institution is a relatively easy way to solve the problem it may however induce insecurity with regard to whether the control are representative population from which the are and that the risk one to examine may be related to the affecting the control assume that you wish examine whether cigarette smoking an risk cancer and the control are selected among in a lung department this would imply that the smoking epidemiology and p page for the control would be likely to deviate from the general and the study would be invalid case control one when a study is to avoid the influence that may contribute to the risk but otherwise are particular interest in the study one approach is matching in which the control and the are selected to be as similar as possible with regard to such as age gender residential area and social class however the drawback is that one may control for related to the that one to assess thereby reducing the possibility one example is that study importance smoking for myocardial infarction assume that you match patient and control with regard to social class this may reduce the possibility the association between smoking and myocardial infarction as smoking is associated with social class cross sectional design and structure a cross sectional study all data at one point in time this the prevalence condition or to be assessed a cross sectional study is intuitively clear and a large number to be the can be standardized by the researcher and may be applied to the exposure and by definition a cross sectional study no dimension so it cannot sup port on the risk or on the inference on causality one way to circumvent this drawback is to formulate that assess an individual s past such as about previous occupation or other this the researcher to categorize with regard to previous exposure chapter p page even collection information at one point in time the inter sectional may to a large extent be similar to that of case control the lack dimension that the cross sectional or prevalence are poorly to examining duration cross sectional may also exhibit recall bias because disease or assessment may influence the response pattern and even the biological a cross sectional study in norway found that those who were most overweight in the population were also those who consumption fat milk it is sonable to imply that low fat milk will increase your body weight but the finding at here the sectional should be carefully an increasing problem in cross sectional as well as cohort is the low response rate or attendance rate an issue that may date the with regard to prevalence assessment cohort design and structure a cohort study is one that a defined group cohort over a given period the usual approach is to start with healthy or unaffected the main purpose is usually to assess the possible effects external or internal on the risk information on exposure about each individual in the population is collected at the or are over time and the final analysis a comparison between those who have healthy and those who have become ill these imply at that differ between the a homogeneous cohort with regard to a variable it impossible to assess the impact variable as a disease risk associated factor for instance there is no way to associate disease with smoking in the cohort been exposed to it at the same dosage since the age of up to the end of the study the principal advantage cohort study is that it the dimension of time which drawing with regard to causal the epidemiology and p page are intuitively easy to understand numerous can be assessed at the same time and one can apply standardized with clear with regard to both exposure and the ascertainment and that are independent as all data on exposure were collected while the are still healthy prospective c are assumed to give a more valid and less result than the other study both incidence rate and incidence rate ratio can be from cohort large cohort permit more than one type to be assessed whereby multiple disease as different exposure might be several practical and inferential are associated with cohort with a low incidence rate are not amenable to drawing causal as too much time is to accrue a sufficient number upon which may be drawn cohort are however suitable for risk that are stable over time and for that are relatively frequent or duration cohort are relatively costly and usually require long follow up as well as an apparatus for follow up and another weakness is that the registration can be inflexible data on exposure are collected at and then used to construct the different exposure that the in the study may undergo during the follow up period may not be taken into account such as change area change or work exposure is these are likely to be unknown to the researcher and lead to underestimation risk assigned to that particular exposure assume that we are following a group of where some are cigarette and have never smoked during the follow up period some stop smoking this that there will be a number in the smoking category the analysis between disease and smoking will be based on the information that was col at as we have no ion on who actually stopped smoking and when the result may be a reduced risk as incidence is lower than that actually associated with smoking this misclassification usually an chapter p page effect measure that the true association between smoking and dis ease repeated exposure during the follow up are one way to try to avoid this kind error the ascertainment the degree or dose is to the cohort cohort will as all other ological contain three principal choice population the study population for exposure ascertainment registration or exposure ascertainment and registration may comprise data collected directly from via biological and or may be data already collected via other such as census data and income data these data can be collected in standardized ways to prevent systematic the work involved however may be substantial one example area where it is difficult to obtain good valid data is registration and other extensive covering myriad have been they may be cumbersome to use cohort group thou data collection should therefore be simplified or organized at a level that is acceptable to the registration and end is time and resource demanding in a cohort study as in practice during the follow up period all must be to ascertain whether they have had any or whether they have or before the end study effect in epidemiological this section will discuss three relative risk or risk ratio odds ratio or incidence rate ratio epidemiology and p page and three derived excess risk attributable risk ar population attributable risk par all are based on risk and or they and the between them depend on the study design used for mating the effects see box the conventional term relative risk is often used in the literature as covering both risk ratio and odds ratio independent study design underlying the this is as well as mathematically incorrect but is acceptable for practical providing certain are confidence effect is given by a confidence interval usually at a level the confidence interval the unknown effect measure with probability the calculation confidence interval for relative risk and odds ratio is given in section the confidence interval for incidence rate ratio is calculated below we examine a sample into being exposed or non exposed to a possible causal factor all are with regard to sub sequent disease a fraction exposed have become ill during the follow up period and a fraction non exposed have also become ill with the same disorder the data can be displayed in a contingency table as shown in table chapter table association between exposure and disease healthy aba the exposed there are this a risk of red among the non exposed the risk r c p page the ratio between these two will express the risk exposed relative to the non exposed this ratio relative risk is given as is a common measure the odds ratio or is another frequently used effect measure for association but may be intuitively understood only by odds are the relationship between two namely the probability for an event divided by the probability for the non event provided that there are only two possible let the probability outcome be pand let only one alternative result emerge e g that the outcome will not occur then the probability for the non event will be p odds are then the ratio between pand p or p p in table exposed were among these exposed be classified as ill or affected the odds for being ill consequently is d divided by b or d b which is the same as the probability of being ill divided by the probability being ill in the group non exposed care as ill or affected and healthy the odds for being ill versus healthy is c a the odds ratio is a comparison two by dividing the odds for both giving going back to the contingency table we will see that this odds ratio is the same as multiplying the diagonally in the table and thereby dividing the product resulting in ad thus this product is the cross product the odds ratio is an effect measure that us how much the odds are for the exposed to be ill than for the non exposed and therefore is considered as an estimate risk for disease table assessment odds for being exposed given that the are affected or healthy there were affected and ab healthy among the there were were exposed to the risk epidemiology and p page factor whereas non exposed the odds for being exposed will be d divided by c or d c whereas in the healthy control group the odds for being exposed against non exposed were b a the two will be by dividing the odds for both this which is the same as we saw when odds for being ill among exposed and non exposed effect in cohort and cohort yield information about risk or incidence rate in exposed and non exposed the effect can be either or the incidence which by division give relative and incidence rate or by subtraction give excess risk example the cohort study of men are given in a table table we know that men from coronary heart disease during a year period and non table association between dying from myocardial infarction and cigarette smoking no yes total table the risk infarction among and non to be the relative risk is p page the risk from myocardial infarction is therefore three times greater among than among non the excess risk is calculated by sub the rate for the non from that or which is that among there will be four more people who will die from myocardial infarction than among non relative risk is a better measure for the strength association between a risk factor and disease than excess risk because relative risk by definition is to the underlying risk assume that table also total length up time see table epidemiology and table association between death from myocardial infarction and cigarette smoking number person we know that the incidence rate is the number divided by total length up time t the incidence rate among the exposed is ire and for non is we define the incidence rate ratio as ire we then find that the excess risk is confidence interval for to estimate the confidence interval for we must transform to a logarithmic scale this is the same transformation as used for a confidence inter val for relative risk or odds ratio see and the standard error for the logarithm incidence rate de and for the it is d the confidence interval for is e e p page by transforming back to an ordinary scale the confidence interval for the incidence rate ratio is example in the analysis de and d the interval is there are in which the excess may be identical although the relative differ markedly in table had been and in the and non the excess risk would still have been but the relative risk in this case would have been the excess risk is the same as in table but the relative risk is now two original value the higher the relative risk the farther away from the the that the association is not by chance but may be an expression direct causal relationship further in section the odds ratio can also be from cohort as the ratio between odds for becoming ill among the expose d and the odds for becoming ill among the non exposed in the example in the contingency table above table the cross product is this is slightly above the relative risk estimate but the difference is small as long as the disease incidence rate or in this case mortality from myocardial infarction is low hence the odds ratio and relative risk are used as corresponding of effect both effect are further and interval are outlined in section or e e chapter p page effect in case control or the case control study is based on and control this that risk cannot be directly based on incidence control and are studied with regard to their exposure in the past in the analyses odds for exposure are and the odds ratio is used as a measure for disease risk attributable risk is a measure proportion disease occurrence that can be a certain risk factor as before the among the exposed and non exposed are r then attributable risk can be expressed by excess risk as re r divided by the risk for those who are exposed to the factor re i e ar re r re this the proportion excess risk for disease that can be to the exposure for the factor in question as relative risk was defined as the risk among exposed divided by the risk for the non exposed this can be ed in the equation for the attributable risk giving ar this is a measure importance factor in explaining the occurrence among the who are exposed the association by not sufficient to argue for causal inference the prevalence pin the total population used to estimate the importance factor for the total disease occurrence a value between and the term prevalence is an epidemiological measure that been used previously in the proportion population who are affected at a given point in time box the term can also be used to indicate the population who are exposed provided that the prevalence exposure is known we can set up an par p p for the attributable risk for the population par is an expression large a those who become ill in the population can be a certain risk factor given the prevalence pand and p page relative risk the equation from the previous but its will not be taken up here both ar and par are mathematical or algebraic statistical association but they provide no additional information on cause and effect par is a measure large the problem is from a public health point for instance how many lung can be to smoking is set to or population and the relative risk for lung cancer to this will give a par of this that lung cancer in the population can be to this particular risk factor the us that the importance factor as a public issue will decline even relative risk remains the same attributable risk can be used as a measure for how much one can achieve with regard to prevention or health promotion prevalence factor is reduced thus the attributable risk can also be expressed or as the potential for a preventive effort experimental and control case case control cross sectional and cohort provide valuable into the between causal and disease risk however these provide little information on effectiveness and or treatment or intervention where one to determine whether a particular exposure actually is harmful or is beneficial this leads to the experimental part in which the main emphasis is on control these differ from cohort in the sense that the or resp for the experiment actually con the exposure status the random al location who is to the respective exposure these are further in section measurement error and of error all measurement error or deviation from a variable s true value our task is to provide the best possible estimate true value the registration or the process the use measurement instrument technical apparatus chapter p page or a questionnaire the magnitude deviation from a variable s true value on the measurement instrument used and the accuracy instrument and the method the deviation from the value is measurement error if the variable is a categorical variable we often speak as the error leads to the subject in a category other than the true one the measurement error found acceptable is based on and and is a practical question depending on the nature problem more accurate as well as are more costly how we cope with the problem on the importance attached to measurement error apparatus or instrument error the purpose measuring instrument is to register or measure a variable in many only indirect are available this two to what extent does w hat we measure reflect what we want to measure how large is the measurement error apparatus or method to the true value variable we are also interested in the repeatability of the measurement instrument which not only on the instrument used but also on the variable measured to what extent does this variable vary within a single individual during a relatively short period it is difficult to repeat a measure ment to a greater degree when the variation is large the variation may imply that we would like to use more from the same to achieve the most valid value possible how many measure will be on the that are being faced and the extent available for taking the precision reliability and validity are in section why measurement occur used for charting eating and are crude and ate whereas genetic and molecular are likely to be far more accurate the lie not only in the design instrument and the way that are but also in how the are used and the people the people vary with regard to epidemiology and p page their own accuracy and there are many for inaccurate and error or the deviation from the true to the same extent up or down from the true value and we also can assume that the true value does not affect the magnitude error the error is classified as random systematic error in contrast when the always go in a certain direction or depend on the true value variable systematic error with the interpretation as it may create artificial or bias that consistently from the true estimate bias and systematic error bias is traditionally sorted into three selection bias information bias and statistical confounding see also box selection bias is a deviation by skewed selection par it owing to a flaw in study design when to be have been selected in different ways the are in all cross sectional and most case control retrospective may differ from those who from the disorder in question and this may imply that we systematically lose information which about survival bias longitudinal cohort entail a number with regard to first who part in the study from the start selective non response and secondly the extent to w all can be up with the same intensity follow people who have been particularly exposed to certain risk we may assume that there is a systematic deviation in the registration or information bias is a systematic deviation where the disease end point the exposure data it may arise in retrospective in which the under study are known to both the observer and the with a certain disorder may be more able to retrieve more about previous dis the use and other than can the healthy con detection bias is systematic error that may arise whenever exposure data are used as an argument for the diagnosis chapter p page confounding that the situation an with a variable other than the one under study we then face an alternative explanation to the association this may occur when there is a strong between the variable that is measured and a confounding factor that either is not measured or is measured with a large random error a multiple regression model may be used to correct for confounding see section confounding can be provided that the in question have been for other is more difficult impossible assume that we have registered smoking in a cohort and have the group for a long time during the follow up period liver damage been reg in some in the material we find that the have a higher risk damage than do the non in these we ask whether this the causal effect variable known to be associated with liver damage that is alcohol consumption were the case it would imply that had higher alcohol consumption than non and as alcohol is associated with liver damage we will get the result for clarification we analyse the effect stratified on those consuming alco and those not consuming alcohol or adjust for the consumption in a statistical analysis this type that we have registered the variable that we wish to control age is often a confounding variable because disease risk usually with increasing age it is therefore ate to present age specific age stratification or age standardized or age as a control variable in a analysis as in section and validity just as the validity association may be one may the validity to distinguish between affected and healthy the validity test may be assessed against a true standard with regard to an individual actually the disease valid are both in medicine and in preventive at to distinguish between healthy and affected or to predict disease or health damage their nature on the problem being epidemiology and p page sensitivity and test is used to determine whether a disorder may occur or not so it may be used to predict disease a test may be made a measurement instrument an auto analyser or a questionnaire the disease is the truth and the better the test in distinguishing the ill from those who have healthy the greater its validity to assess the validity test we divide those who have been into healthy test positive and test negative and display the in a contingency table as in table chapter table association between test and disease negative aba table affected tested positive the validity relevant to those who are ill is therefore d since the total number or ill this the sensitivity test to judge the test to identify those who are healthy we estimate the number oftest negative a and relate this number to all those who are healthy this the specificity test these two sensitivity and specificity express the validity test or in other its ability to measure what it is meant to ure to distinguish those who ill from those who healthy assume now that the test variable is continuous and that with a specific value above a threshold test positive and those with a value below it test negative move the threshold a greater proportion healthy will be included if it is upwards and a smaller proportion included is the lower the threshold the more affected will be included the ratio d and the sensitivity at the same time a pro portion will be classified test positive so the ratio a and the specificity in other in seeking a valid test to all those who are or will become ill some validity in the healthy must be p page predictive power of another goal is to estimate the proportion testing positive who are or will become ill this test char is the test s predictive power it can be the predictability given either a positive test result positive predict power or a negative test result negative predictive power these predictive are evident from the data in the the positive predictive power is the ratio d and the negative predictive power is the ratio a ab example consider two where the same test with known specificity and sensitivity is used for two different sample a and b a and table b are affected table epidemiology and table association between test and disease in a sample of negative positive total table association between test and disease in a sample of that is a subset general population are affected negative positive total the test was valid and distinguished well between healthy and ill with a of and a specificity of in this material affected who tested positive are actually affected so the power positive test is p page in sample b the prevalence disorder is in the general population the sensitivity and specificity both are but the predictive power positive test is in the hospital material out of tested positive and were correctly as affected or ill in this material the test had high predictive power when applied in the general population the result same test was that one individual was falsely found to be ill for each affected individual correctly the predictive power test on the prevalence and will vary even and specificity remain unchanged this implication must be taken into consideration in whether one should test for a rare disorder in the general population the of are that for each truly affected person healthy people will have test positive and be as affected the for and against testing should always consider the for those who are falsely as affected among the test positive predictive power and number to treat when a rare phenomenon with frequent phenomena those identify the frequent phenomena more often than the rare one an example is that within five an otherwise healthy person aged with a systolic blood pressure of is more likely to be alive than dead we may draw similar on the effects treatment such strong predictive rest in part on the likely out comes indeed an old adage that when you hear in the street don t look for a zebra nonetheless we may look for the zebra as seeking out a rare phenomenon is particularly is life threatening yet finding it may be like looking for a needle in a haystack consider for instance that the underlying risk from a certain disorder is low and that there is a treat ment that can reduce this mortality but a large number is to prevent one death this phenomenon led to the concept to treat which also the effect measure effort see section to what extent the intent treatment been it reasonable to treat a group who have a times higher risk for stroke rather than those with only a three times higher risk chapter p page however a low absolute risk which it may well be with at that one must treat a large number in order to prevent a disease or death this is what face in to reduce the risk infarction hip diabetes or stroke in the population healthy among healthy the probability is relatively low even when looking five to ahead the probability for disease is low so to reduce the probability further necessitate treating or upon a large number e g to quit smoking or change their eating to prevent a disease event in short we can only say something about the probability within a group with regard to disease risk and little about the single individual so we must approach the entire group to reduce the risk to attain that goal namely that not one person to an illness during the period studied a large number must be but for all those except the one who actually needs the treatment the treatment will have no the problem is that we cannot identify the individual who will benefit from the treatment and thereby enjoy a longer life of disease definition and a cause or health damage can be defined as the factor that alone or in concert with other can bring forth disease or health damage it is evident that not everyone exposed to a particular causal factor becomes ill the factor may increase the risk affected but only rarely alone and absolutely risk may be defined as the probability for a certain event within a certain period and between and therefore the cause disease can be defined as a factor that the probability occurrence the variation factor in a population is a precondition for it as a causal factor that is easier said than done because homogeneous in which everyone in a population been exposed to a factor completely obscure any association between health damage and this particular factor any variation that with regard to the disease must be to in other a theoretical example is to assess the effect everybody in a population smoke a day from the age epidemiology and p page of until the age of during this time a number will become ill but as they were all the harmful effect tobacco would be impossible to detect all other such as diet and genetic disposition would emerge as associated either increasing risk or being protective homogeneous causal may be a problem since we then may be unable to detect an effect this may be the reason why it is difficult to detect an effect intake on blood pressure or an effect fat on breast cancer within whereas ecological between show strong this also that the factor that a disease in a single individual in the population from the de whether there is more disease in one population than in another the precondition for being able to identify an association is that the variation between interindividual variation is than the vari on single variation thus in overly homogeneous or with excessive vari it is impossible to identify one way to avoid this problem is to examine known to differ with regard to the factor exam that are seen in ecological but not in where the are the observation may lead to the conclusion that there is no association between the factor and the disease risk however this con may be false as the individual variation may be large alternatively differ between may be due to other than the one for instance the example and blood pressure may imply that with low blood pressure consume considerable and in addition to a low salt diet and otherwise differ from salt necessary and sufficient causal causal or health damage are said to be necessary or sufficient a necessary factor must be present for a disorder to occur without it the dis order will not occur for instance a member mycobacterium tuberculosis chapter p page family must be present for tuberculosis to occur without it tuberculosis does not occur few necessary are deterministic in that they act alone and always cause a disorder indeed many people have been exposed to the tuberculosis bacterium without the disease a factor acts in concert with one or more necessary to increase the probability occurrence disorder alone a factor need not be necessary as the disorder may occur without it a sufficient factor usually a complex or more necessary and that together can trigger an occurrence the complex that is sufficient to cause a disorder that may be considered equally important however the vary among for instance one subject may have a genetic disposition that cigarette smoking more harmful lack reparation whereas another person may be more susceptible to saturated fatty this line for and preventive some single in causal may be easier to handle than for instance environmental and are simpler to manipulate than genetic and are often studied by or refer but comparison is seldom straightforward consider the extensively studied issue contraceptive increase the risk by causing an increase in breast cancer uterine cancer or other when this problem one must ask what the alternative is with whom shall the be should they be to with low sexual activity who avoid the associated with pregnancy and child birth or to alternative control or to not any sort control the final conclusion to your research question may depend on the choice to whom the exposed have been epidemiology and p page association versus causality when does an association express a causal relationship the association between a measured factor and a disease may express three relevant to disease the association is causal variable a leads to disease b such as cigarette smoking leading to bronchial carcinoma the variable is the intermediary part causal chain x a factor so far unknown to us affected the organism whereby variable a will emerge or be and be detectable this is a process that will precede the disorder b in the causal chain are cytological in the cervix malignant or electro cardiographic later myocardial infarction such are often intermediary they can be assessed as risk as they are associated with disease but they may also be in a study where the main interest is to examine why the vary such may be surrogate the variable is associated with an alternative factor which is the real cause for instance alcohol consumption may be associated with bronchial carcinoma but cigarette smoking is the causal factor alcohol a predictive power but this on the association between alcohol and cig not that alcohol as a single factor is a cause carcinoma any can be used when disease as part battery in order to predict a single individual s risk even if there is no direct causal association whether an association should be accepted as a causal relationship is always a matter based on the available evidence the we must ask ourselves when facing an association are is this association a random or chance finding is the association a systematic error a bias either in selection of the sample taking part in the study or because measurement being used can this association be by another factor or confounding chapter p page these three leads us to discuss whether the association really is causal in a biological sense in his textbook sir bradford hill stated a number that should be before a conclusion regarding causal is reasonable the list with regard to the strength association expressed for instance by relative risk consistent from different preferably also with different that the causal factor is by the effects and that the association is understandable from a biological view point the list been as criteria that must be but several have it hill s original intention was not that one should all the every time causality can never be proven but is the result within the medical research community the list replicated in box is a useful instrument and review to think about causality within health epidemiology and box to be in causality strength consistency specificity temporality biological gradient biological plausibility coherence experiment analogy

oxford university press oxford greenland s modern epidemiology new york chapter p page chapter qualitative research and quantitative research qualitative enable to study social and cultural phenomena data are acquired on individual and group or the principal goal is to find out how people experience and interpret their own existence qualitative research generate data that cannot be or for which quantification is pointless these data can be in but not in the fundamental idea research is that phenomena are accessible to the researcher via particular with and subject or studied in such phenomena is decisive in understanding how a culture and for our understanding of why people act as they do in concrete one cannot understand how a culture and why people act as they do without looking into how they experience and interpret the world the world as people perceive it in seeking an understanding people behave as they do realizing that this is so can be essential in and health policy smoking is a good example there is a soundly statistical between smoking and lung cancer nonetheless people do not stop smoking p page to the degree they should and many young people start many ing campaign have not as intended why is that so and what are the facing the stop smoking one reason may be that many people have yet to know about the connection between smoking and cancer and still believe that smoking is safe the antismoking primarily face an information problem the medical approach traditionally been that once the connection between smoking and lung cancer is made widely known people will stop smoking but smoking is more complex so a second reason may be that it in more extensive such as tough being socially popular affecting indifference to risk and so on whenever such outweigh health for an individual stopping smoking may seem the antismoking face a problem on and who shall i be how shall i live my life an understanding and a third reason may be that although the connection between smoking and lung cancer is well known most may believe that lung cancer to not themselves people tend to regard themselves as more invulnerable than they actually are the antismoking face the challenge deep rooted in the human perception some people may start smoking or refuse to stop smoking to signal protest such as to antismoking such behaviour yet another problem for antismoking to make sense people continue to smoke and start smoking despite the known link between smoking and lung cancer we must first fathom how they experience and perceive the world what and they have and so on quantitative research such as can provide but other ways piling data are to obtain a more picture role of smoking in the daily and qualitative research from quantitative research in at least three ways first qualitative research is usually intensive in contradistinction to extensive intensive research few and relatively many an example is a recent study male in which young gay men were several times over a period the number of interview is typical for qualitative research that said a biography is the chapter p page most extreme case qualitative approach it is about a single person so there is just one object but there are myriad that may be relevant an example is a recent biography norwegian mathematician nils abel extensive research many and relatively few the case is quantitative research to find the correlation between two such as between income and gender in a representative sample of however in most quantitative there are more than two but nonetheless a limited number quantitative research on width qualitative research on depth secondly quantitative and qualitative research differ in the organization research process the phases quantitative research study are relatively dis design hypothesis generation data collection and analysis the phases qualitative research study mingle and cannot be clearly distinguished much generation and analysis place as data are acquired moreover qualitative research may involve several concurrent data collection such as observing and thirdly qualitative research data such as participant observation focus and qualitative below these yield data that must be qualitative research the role research remains particularly in the social quantitative and qualitative research have their and but today it is relatively accepted that there are at least six key first qualitative research is particularly to gaining understanding of people s lived that is how people experience and view believe and think aspire and assess the world about them what is it like to live with a chronic illness how does one cope with a handicapped child how do deal with various what and illness exist in a population and how do they change secondly qualitative research is particularly to in complex social and cultural phenomena and to how they function in qualitative research p page practice what do people hold and how are bound into a system what rise to the between people and human behaviour in con text qualitative focus on the relationship between human behaviour and the various in which it itself thirdly qualitative research may be used to describe distinctiveness the major anthropological twentieth century were sort for example s study society pacific s study magic azande people in sudan barth s study people guinea barth or s study judicial barotse people the aim is to describe a culture or an aspect as thoroughly as possible to find out what is distinctive or unique about it fourthly qualitative may be used to generate hypotheses that then can be tested by other qualitative research an open character the researcher often not with a concise hypothesis but rather with an inkling that something is significant or relevant it is precisely this open character that qualitative research to hypothesis generation fifthly qualitative can be amenable as pilot precursory to quantitative and also may be used to collect data that help to interpret statistical material finally qualitative may be used to test hypotheses as one occurrence is sufficient to refute or falsify a general hypothesis the hypothesis that all are white is single k swan can be found p qualitative case are often to seek out black it is essential to distinguish between hypothesis testing and generalization one may test a hypothesis with out the test may consist a generalization conversely one may generalize without testing what qualitative research cannot be used for most notable is that qualitative research cannot be used for generalization in the statistical sense principally for two both by e research the first reason is that the sample in qualitative research chapter p page is usually too small and usually is not randomly selected the sample usually people some times sometimes more the sample is selected strategically not randomly this that the researcher for their being able to provide relevant for the topic being studied however to generalize in the statistical sense one needs a sufficiently large sample selected in a procedure the second reason can be by the difference between a survey based on and a qualitative research interview study in a survey study the and often the alternative are standardized this is done to permit comparison to the same given by different people for this to be possible one must ensure that the answer the same and that they interpret the phrasing in the same way the standardization and sometimes is done principally to promote greater comparability this alone does not guarantee against bias in bias may arise for the choice and the manner in which are in contrast a qualitative research interview no standardized the researcher often only an interview guide to be the interview as a conversation that can go in various according to who in such an interview there is usually no point in the same question to all the point can rather be to ask different as different will have unlike information and unlike that may be in qualitative the involved in a sample are as fundamental in qualitative as they are in quantitative but in qualitative the sample is strategic and often cannot be selected in advance as for quantitative qualitative are open to criticism criteria their use to select the studied in qualitative research one the to be in some stud it is advantageous to seek maximum variation in a sample to elicit as many and as many different as possible there are several qualitative research p page to accomplish that the time and place for must be chosen not least because people often say different at different times in different it is one thing to interview people at their another to inter view them in their in participant observation must be made will be and where and when they will be if for instance the aim is to study the and at a hospital the researcher must be present when food is prepared and many phenomena such as are cyclical so they can be studied only researcher the cycle other phenomena are sporadic so the researcher must find when and where they occur some phenomena may be so shrouded in secrecy that a researcher cannot observe them at all reliability and validity the bottom line on the accuracy with which research work is validity to the question the researcher and the chosen actually measure that which the study to measure or illustrate that to be at the outset reliability and validity are separate a meticulously accurate study need not illustrate what the researcher to illustrate conversely a stud y with the potential what the researcher may be so slipshod that it is worthless the question in similar ways in quantitative and qualitative research both involve that require accurate conduct for example in quantitative research must be accurately structured in qualitative research voice must be accurately to text if poorly or by different people in different ways are value reliability may be checked in both qualitative and such as by seeing whether there is agreement in the when different people code the same questionnaire or transcribe the same interview validity is not quite the same in the two in research it is probably more correct to speak continual process and this process is basically that consider an example canadian sociologist as total that assertion chapter p page whether it on any central hospital organization this can be done only through looking into whether the assertion that involved experience as an decisive or correct ways do they recognize s description do they feel that the notion to the organization to answer such the characterization must be to people involved and their to it however such validation is an tain process with great leeway for interpretation some may recognize the char not moreover many might recognize the characterization but be unwilling to so admit as they view the concept of total institution as provocative or as a threat to their self image this an illuminating aspect research qualitative research about upon which those involved often may have strong and divergent the validation process also interpretation involved that the concept of total institution is central why do they agree disagree why is it because the concept does not strike a central matter or is it because the concept a central matter but in such a way that those concerned will neither admit nor say so differ why do they differ is it because such have some that but not to the extent or is it because the researcher s use concept latent that otherwise would not have surfaced in and the researcher must continually deal with such considerable exercise and sensitivity to of interpretation ethical in qualitative research the research are in principle the same for qualitative and research in practice they differ in the ways in which they may be informed consent is an example informed consent is a difficult theme it that the consenting are in full possession cognitive so they can understand what they consent to this it difficult for example to involve in research it also it difficult to involve men tally ill or retarded people in research for the researcher seeking participant qualitative research p page observation at a hospital ward it is undeniably tempting to pretend to be a patient without the research intent with the thought in mind that both those who treat and those who are will modify their behaviour and know that a researcher is present a similar argument might be advanced by a researcher seeking participant in a local community however such an end the rationale is clearly unethical are obliged to identify themselves and state the for their presence another aspect is that qualitative research is not always easily even though clearly state at the outset and hon answer all about themselves and the always arise on the way in which it is unnatural destructive or directly provoking when the researcher must continually remind people research being and that daily comprise data a q re searcher is often on the job round the clock so as an observer or a participant in inter active it is easy to come into contact with people to a degree from that which the principal were on in advance concerning the purpose study several ago one chapter b i fieldwork on greenland in which participant observation was the principal data collection technique the goal project was to study the impact development initiative a shrimp canning factory on the town and the adjacent small data collection took place in the tory in which all were informed in the where the and the researcher lived and in all the social in which factory took part and street corner even though most town had a notion the researcher was there every day new fishing with potential for the factory so it would have been impossible to ensure that everyone present be kept on the project and its goal another problem is that qualitative data are subject to for safekeeping information and for constraining the time frame in which data may be used data protection such as those across require that personal data be anonymous and be within a time frame see for instance the relevant eu directive on europa eu justice home privacy index en this is easily met by the quantitative chapter p page researcher who progressively data on a computer in contrast the researcher often needs to trace back to the original who have fictitious and to revert to the information in a relatively long analytical process in addition there are ethical that although not specific to research are conspicuous because the relationship between a researcher and an informant is closer in qualitative research than in quantitative research the must feel that the research is meaningful responsibility for the data protection and when necessary responsibility for responsibility to and door o as in the form and feedback responsibility for own behaviour the requirement that research be seen as meaningful by the study is not unique to but more important in qualitative research this is because the qualitative researcher comes in close contact with the study inform and consequently must be prepared to explain the purpose many in qualitative fieldwork friendship often between a researcher and the at least while the researcher is in the field and that responsibility is felt to be even more binding the same is true for who often reside in the country or the local culture and will stay there after the fieldworker leaves researcher ethically such as by data or by information that is in some way the may easily suffer subsequent in general it may be said that one should foresee and attempt to guard against injury to those involved first this can be done by for people and by the place where data are collected sometimes these are inadequate so and may need to be slightly however the cannot be so extensive that it the analytical in the data being collected often may be made unrecognizable qualitative research p page for but nonetheless remain recognizable to the then it is wise to go back to the and let them read the or have them read so they can approve or propose one chapter b i once wrote a paper based on in depth on their personal illness it soon apparent that complete was impossible as the case were easily recognizable in the small professional community apprehensive the sent the draft manuscript to the three to elicit christie had writing the paper been in vain would they refuse to let us publish it all three gave their permission and sent constructive back for revision of the draft it is better to ask once too often than not enough times may ask whether they will be for qualitative inter often take up to two or more so it is not so strange that an informant may ask about compensation for time spent in norway seldom involve payment to as it is assumed that some mutual inter in the conversation may be built however for in poor it may seem inequitable not to offer compensation for time that otherwise might be spent in farming or other necessary a solution may be to bring along as money into the picture may create an atmos that invidiously the data collection some ethnic that are frequently by have set up in which permission to con duct research must be specifically by an organization them each informant a fixed amount for an interview and the organization income from a percentage from the book or film about the project this is the case for the san people the researcher is also responsible for and who have made the research possible both financially and research and fund ing require and other may expect feedback in the form the opportunity to review and so on many in complain that often to send back and on that they have been given permission to conduct here we all bear the responsibility for correcting such in recent it become more usual to conduct research jointly with the country partnership in chapter p page feedback to the country in which research is and to building in the institution responsibility to is primarily in two ways by properly cit ing research by and by not upon the work in principle the for the work apply to all research yet across research the plagiarism and is an increasing prob in qualitative research and even whole are copied without the source it that analyses in the form are not to the same degree as analyses in and upon the work entering a field where are research in a manner that their work there are no written for conduct in such just unwritten in quantitative research two working on similar seldom interfere with each other but in qualitative research the researcher who is established and set up in a local may be seriously perturbed colleague then comes in at the same time to study a related problem however qualitative the same over time can mutually enhance each other s work moreover this in the aspect as a control and validity a good rule for a researcher s own behaviour in the field is that it should not offend this also on the cultural context in which the research is for example a female researcher in a culture need not necessarily wear a veil but she should refrain from dressing in shorts and a tight fitting top a male researcher in a culture where men and are should forget western chat up customs in his spare time some may view such advice as a constraint on a researcher s individuality but the aim is to evolve a strategy that the best possible respect and confidence in relation with potential moreover one should not spoil the of to conduct research a researcher who decently according to local will leave a good impression that will benefit who follow qualitative data collection in qualitative research the connotation of method is than in research the word not just the technique data but qualitative research p page also the collection process that a theoretical approximation to a prob approach the data collection the running analysis ing and after qualitative data are collected this section at this process which the or that may be used to collect research data the list may be long and limited only by imagination here only the principal and most used are participant observation qualitative ethnography life mode grounded theory rapid rural assessment and participatory rural assessment in addition there are related and supplementary that are beyond the scope chapter historical linguistic photographic participant observation participant observation is first as in a way it is the parent research by the old who long often repeated fieldwork in isolated and well h detailed people did r with participation in their daily doings and to elicit their meaning content and the classic got under the skin culture studied and thereby understanding the people their existence this perspective become known as from phonemic in chapter p page linguistics at the same time the ethnographer to elicit and that perhaps were not always clear to the individual actor this per become known as from phonetic in linguistics fieldwork is paramount in participant observation ideally fieldwork should be duration at least one year the fieldworker was to live with the local culture and learn its language so well as not to need an inter today few can finance a research stay than a year s duration or often less and the use become more accepted and customary more recently participant have been used to study milieu or that to a degree are such as youth hospital depart local in industrial or rural in the importance culture is clearly prominent in participant observation both at home and abroad but equally well to all qualitative social medical research culture understood as a network with which people surround themselves the basis for understanding and qualitative data qualitative now there are hardly any more traditional in which a researcher can observe and participate in almost all communal life consequently the for traditional participant observation are limited although par observation is still used in delimit ed milieu such as local and hospital at once the more complex cultural create new for the qualitative researcher for example one will seldom study the particular medical diagnosis by down in a single local culture the potential often are spread over a far area probably with no more than one or two in each local culture another may be that modern people are often uninterested in into their personal these can be faced by to other supplementary such as the qualitative interview it can take many a completely open and qualitative research p page interview not in advance a conversation in advance or a more open query included in an otherwise structured quantitative questionnaire the open interview can be spontaneous in the follow up particular hap or it may be and agreed in advance with the informant the principle interview is that it is a freely flowing conversation on a selected topic in which the researcher to attain the trust and confidence per son a useful approach is for the researcher to assume the role pupil who to learn the informant then is given the impression the expert on the topic at hand namely his or her own life but that approach may fail informant becomes preoccupied with correct which are a poor point in a qualitative interview however the interview is more by the researcher who preferably comes with a list based on the topic to be touched upon during the con versation the list is drawn up both to ensure that essential are not for gotten and to ensure that all are thematically fairly alike however within this frame the conversation should flow as naturally as and need not necessarily be taken up in the same order in all inter some may prefer to formulate part in advance but most have found that this the conversation and it more like filling out a questionnaire a workable rule for a interview is to start with something meaningful to the person in relation to the agree ment made if for example the interview living with a particular it is wise to begin by the informant about how and when the affliction rather than posing the standard on address income and so on which can be put aside until later in the conversation in this manner it is easier to awaken the informant s interest in the interview which is beneficial for the rest conversation qualitative may be voice or may be written down a voice recording the advantage that it accurately what been said but also the disadvantage that the amount collected is large and transcription can be excessively time consuming and expensive when done by an interview respectively written by the researcher should as much as possible be put to paper immediately after the interview goes chapter p page by or perhaps there are several before any are written down record ing accuracy a structured questionnaire primarily intended for quantitative research may also be combined with more open for which the informant s are written down in as much detail as possible some computer such as the statistical package for the social support insertion of such however the big question then is how such are to be afterwards they are not for quantification unless they are subjected to extensive systematization and and for qualitative research alone they often are out and overly brief and consequently use they are best as short expressed quantitatively such as when a general dissatisfaction or satisfaction with a treat ment is with a pertinent quote from one many have qualitative interview general psych and all use as one more useful however a research interview is distinguished from a classical clinical interview in that to a far greater degree the control over and definition is vital is up to the person it is decisive that the conversation the interviewee s concept not clinical that may help a specialist to reach a diagnosis to a greater degree than ever general and now seek to elicit their with their own and also integrate these in research psychologist is among the in the development qualitative interview as a research tool in a landmark text he forth the theoretical basis for and the tical in research the principal message book is that social interaction in knowledge production are in to prompt to give triggered by the researcher s question the story is usually angled towards a particular theme such as in or the for a particular social group as for qualitative inter in general it is pertinent to interpretation to be aware that a career qualitative research p page in an interview is not a documentation fact but rather a story that the stamp context in which it is told between the interviewer and the interviewee and presentation of the the informant to give most often designate shorter time span such as those are subject to the same on interpretation as are qualitative in general they are formed by the time and place by the relationship between the interviewer and the interviewee and by the inter s for self presentation ethnography the complex modern society have anthropologist george e to launch ethnography which is not a method data but rather a statement ways data that capture exactly the that reflect the local phenomena one or more following for data collection follow people follow an

in art and literature in and so on martin in following a story one may for example become interested in how a happening is related differently by different involved in it these can themselves provide leads to identify important power and phenomena in a culture used this method in her study killing case in finally we will discuss an old anthropological strategy that used to be the extended case method that is the following dramatic happening or con in in the s that revealed the various tribal and principal agenda more recently the method been used in follow e g in in a young kurdish woman was by her father the reason given was that she had found a swedish and wished to live her life in the modern swedish manner the family felt the murder trial s father and wrote a book and several on

to the relevant drama life mode psychologist and have a method that to compensate for the difficulty participant over time in modern busy at the outset the method is a study of how time is spent but goes further in seeking to elicit a family s mode hence the name life mode and have for daily and social norwegian fam with five year old the method family me or individually depending on the approach project on the course previous day from the first sign in the morning until the last family member goes to bed in the evening a record is made each family member did individually and together with at short min it is amazing what people can recall previous day once they get aside from what did you do yesterday for each sequence one can ask was it a usual day or happening and was that as it should be in this manner the researcher can cor rect for unusual days and also include the normative aspect however with so detailed it often turns out that the informer s are exhausted or impatient midway in the description day so then it is best to stop and come back later in a fresh interview that where the first stopped hence for each interview object or family yesterday half days it can be advantageous interview is not concerned with a particular day but rather with the life mode family in the course day grounded theory grounded theory is a method and qualitative data that was in the s by and their aim was to give qualitative and analyses a more systematic character than previously had been the case in much research in the field chapter p page among other this was done to meet the quantitative research require ment are accurately and with no instead the arise from the data qualitative the of this chapter maintain that such a starting point is illusory and not even able as we always start with concerning the research we con duct and indeed our theoretical ballast is a useful tool in the collection and analysis see section regardless grounded theory is instructive for in its meticulous recording in the field grounded theory probably been most used by nursing and to a degree also by this is natural considering that the relevant are often that are easily such as hospital where almost all social that take place may be rapid rural assessment and participatory rural assessment rapid rural assessment and participatory rural assessment are for rapid collection data especially for use in and evaluation the principal difference between the two is that less participation population involved than does both and build on simple that can be used with local preferably with active involvement to which they are applied and have been used principally in but also in in norway been used in the municipality to assess the population s m land is a typical western norwegian coastal community it is on an island and a population few thousand most live by fishing farming and a little trading it is probably typical small local around the world see box even though and were not specifically designed for qualitative research but are more for in project and conduct there is one namely focus the focus group technique is used extensively partly in to chart a new field before a often quantitative study partly to carry on that have come up in and partly as a qualitative research p page solo method in short as in the method a focus group is a group of people brought together and to discuss a specific topic one or more direct the discussion ensure that all have their say and put forward additional to keep the discussion going the discussion is voice for subsequent transcription or an assistant detailed writ ten the size and composition group depend on the theme usually there are no more than people in a group and often it is suitable to have than if for instance a study to study nursing the group will bring together who are nursing their but it also may be illuminating to have a focus group a group a group who have finished nursing and so on in data collected at a focus group meeting be aware that the forum the statement made in a public group discussion often reflect what is commonly accepted and more than what people actually do and think for example in a focus group discussion in local community in southern chapter box participatory rural assessment an example and wish to develop for local and charting one used was to hold popular in the municipal the by a local volunteer organization in all house in a ward in the were to speak out on concerning health and well being in their local and any that the had been or would be exposed to the ended with project to carry out the that had been agreed upon the sum of from the that the people had a broad under standing on what could promote in their municipality the principal that people wished to were for the elderly for well being for physical study volunteer and cultural m land p page the question on functionally disabled people often that they are down upon and even hidden away yet in the same local community made people or with them and their often reveal a different picture most with dis manage as well as they can and most disabled people have accepted in and in the community hence data from focus group can easily mislead influence public nature group is and the data are in the same manner as are data from individual the chapter advise against preferential use group dis to generate qualitative data we maintain that the method is best to preliminary before other quantitative or are used or for in depth field on already familiar such as through a quantitative study a poll or long term participant triangulation triangulation in research to the use data or in a single phenomenon triangulation two or more research the goal may be for the to supple ment each other or for their combination to contribute to the validity and reliability investigation the term triangulation is derived from land sur where it to the use to map out an area in principle qualitative and quantitative can be in two ways first a pattern in the data quantitative investigation can be qualitatively studied in depth secondly the qualitative investigation in a geographical area or limited sample may in a subsequent study be tested to explore their applicability to a and more sample population in practice almost all research include an element angulation for example participant often may be with interview with key or with data from in and public likewise in qualitative interview keep their and open as much as qualitative research p page possible to gain an impression surroundings small during an interview may also influence the interpretation data collected triangulation may take place in many ways as by the example from in box al at the outset the project was yet it used several qualitative to validate and supplement each other the and multinational composition research team may also be as a form a few after the end project the same in norway and in a national survey elderly based on a representative sample population as this book goes to press these data have yet to be fully and but thus far the support those in depth study in box chapter box triangulation combining quantitative an at the institute practice and community medicine university a study elderly in in with the university the project care for the elderly care by the elderly to find out how the rapid development since it independence had affected the elderly both those needing care and those providing care in the project the faced the decision it should be quantitative or qualitative that is whether it should be focus on breadth or depth the qualitative approach was chosen because the aim was to collect data on how the elderly experienced their how did they view the that had taken place and how did they feel that they best could be in their situation from that the research team selected a village assumed to be fairly across the country and so close to the capital to be in many ways affected by the modernization process all people over were inter by a multinational and research team and the used included a medical check up a simple health test a health interview a household interview a depth p page analyses of qualitative data the data resulting from a qualitative research process are personal systematic project retrospectively written voice or focus written by the themselves literature and newspaper still the project logbook is a pivotal data record in it record the phases research process made given by people and their own and in the course work a logbook should be kept regardless strategy chosen for data collection it going back to review one s own and refreshing initial at a later stage at which may have been found to that were initially puzzling in the first phase the researcher is a sponge for absorbing all later when the fieldwork become more routine it can be illuminating to recall that initial curiosity desired the logbook may be divided in two a diary for more personal and a more systematic project lo organized by the analysis qualitative research interview people focus group and from school and participant observation upon completion of the project a seminar was in the capital and donor organization and village people were the project were the national gallery featured an and a video was shown to the the attention that the seminar to concern for the elderly being put on the political agenda and to an old age pension for everyone over being in a couple later p page data from that in that it and place throughout the research process the continually ongoing analyses in qualitative research help to guide the evolution collection in con in quantitative research analysis is a more explicit phase that place after the data collection phase to a greater degree analysis finding suit able statistical relevant to the data acquired later the resulting are but upon finishing a qualitative investigation one is left with myriad data and some rudimentary made to analyse it during the course fieldwork the sheer amount can be for instance that a one hour qualitative research interview may result in text so will result in in addition participant may generate in various from and single to longer text the in focus will add more text the analysis to create order in this wealth in view approach project this may be done in many ways here we discuss two concept formation and narrative a greater part analysis data finding rich inter as sociologist erik wright out are made not

essence it the story what it is about the plot and the story s time frame can arrange the collected data to appear as a meaningful whole narrative analysis can be used in various ways qualitative research often are amenable to as the are free to speak as they please and often are aged by the interviewer to tell a story also are well to comparison for example interview data may reveal that many

for qualitative research are to a considerable degree for grounded theory data but may also be used for other qualitative data these do not analyse data but rather help to arrange and locate data they replace the file scissors and glue past but do not replace keeping however the as logbook may be such qualitative data according to there are five possible qualitative research process the enthusiasm

quantifiable objective data as the fieldwork and the researcher still is enthusiastic the interview phase in which the researcher to share new with within the chapter p page later after writing and those nearest begin to tire the researcher the working phase the duration on the scope data and on the researcher s energy and writing skill but invariably is longer than the researcher then the aggressive phase where even friendly on the progress work are taken as personal it is hoped that few ever reach the final phase in which one up the entire project but all regardless inevitably occasionally find themselves in where must be according to the art possible the best must not be the enemy good qualitative data are continuously so from the first or one cannot distinguish and analysis in in the same manner that they are distinguished in medical this may be a barrier to fortunately with time social science and medicine and other have been to overcome that barrier the presentation may but need not necessarily follow the traditional sequence theory method one may for example start with a biographical sketch or a description situation that the reader into the context studied one should aim for readable presentation not use foreign and put forth theory that not the material for the reader this is particularly the case in writing for medical who often are more concerned with applicability than with theoretical the distinction between good qualitative research and good writing in part on theory being the foundation but at the same time it is best that research well and the writing are close to those research qualitative research come to stay in medicine and with time is likely to gain greater acceptance as more medical start qualitative f knowledge

statistical petter thore and eva introduction this chapter the statistical analysis and numerical data see section for for categorical data contingency tables and logistic regression are used to analyse association between the binomial distribution is briefly as it is essential to understanding the and analyses related to categorical data for con numerical data statistical analyses that can be by normal as well as by non normal will be in the latter case non parametric will be examine d the choice statistical method on understanding the distributional made the normal is particularly important because many depend so this is in depth towards the end chapter more advanced regression are and the focus will be on the effect the associated effect estimate on confidence and p these are essential for the statistical analyses and continuous data as in box several are the data are accessible at in both standard text format and p page statistical package for the social format the statable program is used to compute p and effect measure hypothesis testing and confidence interval the main involved in statistical analyses are in box entail the assessment and measurement health outcome the outcome may be the result treatment in a trial or in an epidemiological study such as a study effect during pregnancy on birth weight accordingly first an effect measure must be chosen for the case effect during pregnancy the effect measure could be chosen as the difference in average birth born to non smoking and smoking then the effect measure must be giving us the effect estimate clearly the effect measure chosen and the way it is depend on the study design and type for the that measure the outcome a confidence interval most n with a confidence level is used to assess uncertainty a confidence the unknown true value chapter box main the effect measure is derived from the outcome variable it is the mag that the statistical description in a study the null hypothesis h is the hypothesis that we seek to reject a null hypothesis is tested by a test statistic and the associated p value the p value is the calculated probability for the result or that are even more contradictory to the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is correct a confidence interval the unknown true value with probability p page with probability increasingly require that the effect measure be stated along with its confidence interval to enable assessment magnitude and significance effect the approach to a study is in its research hypothesis for example a research hypothesis may be that the differ or that there is an association between smoking during pregnancy and birth weight of then a testable statistical hypothesis the null hypothesis is an example might be that two normal have the same mean in which case the null hypothesis is no difference the normal distribution is in greater detail in section the p value the basis for the null hypothesis and consequently an alternative hypothesis which is the research hypothesis computation p value is below a research paper usually should include three relevant the effect estimate the confidence interval for the effect measure and the p value statistical hypothesis related to it in the following these are dis cussed in greater detail then for selected the choice measure will be as well as the computation associated confidence interval and p value null hypothesis alternative hypothesis and p approach to a problem computation of p is inextricably linked to the null hypothesis h and the alternative hypothesis h hypothesis testing always for a null hypothesis which is the postulate that we seek to reject assume for instance that we wish to determine whether the effects differ the null hypothesis is then that the two have equal effects the effect measure is then zero and the alternative hypothesis is that the effects of the two differ the alternative hypothesis may be one sided or two sided it is one sided are bound to be in one direction it is two sided are interested in to either side such as either positive or negative effects two sided alternative hypotheses are the most common in medical a null hypothesis is tested by a test statistic in statistical analyses we wish to learn whether an effect is large to random variation expressed as standard error consequently a test statistic is selected based on statistical p page estimate standard error this is the standard form for all parametric the p value is the calculated probability result as well as other even more contradictory to the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is correct computation p value for a one sided alternative hypothesis from that for a two sided alternative hypothesis for a two sided hypothesis the p value is normally twice the p value one sided hypothesis most often one that a p value less than a statistically cant result so that the null hypothesis may be a significant result may be as a strong indicator real difference in contrast a high p value such as greater than is not synonymous with the null hypothesis being correct confidence interval an effect measure is in an experiment its form on the design and on the statistical model used the ion effect measure is associated with uncertainty in turn uncertainty is by the confidence interval which in a percentage usually the probability that it the true but unknown value effect measure effect measure is a difference the value of to no difference such as no difference between the effects confidence interval does not include the value of the p value corresponding hypothesis test will be less than accordingly the confidence interval may be used to draw on an effect if however we consider a ratio such as the relative risk section the value to no effect and our will be based on whether the confidence interval the value or not the three main listed in box summarize the statistical analysis chapter box presentation of the main statistical effect estimate uncertainty effect estimate reflected in the confidence interval or more hypothesis expressed in p p page trial a sequence of is a trial provided that exactly one a can occur in each trial in all the probability is the same for the namely p a pand p a p in a maternity ward comprise an example trial for example outcome indicate the birth girl in the variable the number of will follow a binomial distribution the true unknown probability is p see box the notation p the estimator unknown probability as is standard in the statistical literature statistical box estimation standard error and confidence interval for estimator unknown probability p proportion in the sample with property standard error is by the binomial distribution can be by a normal distribution in which the confidence interval for given as the key for the estimator p and the standard error of p result from the binomial distribution example the heart study is a large cohort study to study the risk for coronary heart disease a random selection of people from data on people aged by al and given at data is made available in the p page data file at here the heart disease will be studied as a categorical variable with two mutually exclusive presence or absence heart disease consequently we choose to present the distribution as a frequency distribution in table let outcome heart disease the for a trial are then since this is a random sample and the unknown probability for coronary heart disease is as p consequently the proportion heart disease is to be or which a confidence interval of a different sample would have in an estimate from the uncertainty in the estimation of given by the confidence interval above and calculated as in box more precisely we can say that we are certain that the true value within a confidence interval se chapter table frequency distribution heart disease no evidence evidence total first we are interested not only in the frequency distribution cat but in the bivariate association between two categorical vari as they are in contingency tables table is one example are between an outcome variable dependent variable and an explanatory variable there are many exposure vari able independent variable and there is no generally accepted tice for such tables we choose to present the contingency table with the outcome variable in the and the explanatory variable in the the association between the heart disease and elevated systolic blood pressure hypertension can be as in table in this case elevated blood pressure is defined as a pressure over p page the aim is to study the effect blood pressure on coronary heart dis ease so the are within each category blood sures as can be seen in table or a proportion of with a systolic blood pressure than had coronary heart disease the proportion among those without elevated blood pressure is the effect measure is based on the risk heart disease among men with systolic blood pressure over and under many ways this can be done medical statistics most often use relative risk and or as the absolute risk reduction or the equivalent risk difference is less often used although it might be just as natural regardless effect measure chosen attention is on its associated confidence inter val moreover the significance association is assessed by statistical testing here s chi squared test statistic will be used to determine whether there is significant association between the this presentation several so that may be on a calculator or manually although a statistical program such as more readily the we have chosen to do this for several rea sons in general detailed knowledge can give understanding moreover in this area relatively simple may be used in many yet another and perhaps more vital reason is that one should be able to compute or and manually as the provided by statistical depend on how the vari are for example reversing the hypertension blood pressure variable might change or from to the conclusion drawn from the statistical table association between coronary heart disease and elevated systolic blood pressure no evidence count evidence count total count p page analysis remains unchanged but its formulation must match the or the chosen frame simple are therefore vital as they provide an independent check on the produced by a statistical program for some we have chosen small to make manual easy in this chapter the important for calculating the confidence inter val and the p hypotheses are based on an approximation between the binomial distribution and the normal distribution the is quite good when n p both exceed which that the number in the table is greater than when the number is less than an exact method is used to compute the correct confidence interval and p fisher s exact test is one such test for contingency tables table is an example a table more generally are and the corresponding table will be an table as an alternative to exact monte carlo may be used to compute the confidence interval and p these are not in this chapter for see statistical such as those listed in the reference list to this chapter exact and monte carlo can be statistical such as exact or two table may be used to study the association between and hyper tension in the are considered as there is one trial for with blood below n and one for those above n our goal is to determine whether the for coronary heart disease differ for the and above systolic blood pressure in general we assume that we have two with the probability by p p a for trial and p p a for trial we find the for p and p respectively and assess whether p p the research hypothesis a description association between the outcome variable property a explanatory variable trial falsification null hypothesis of p p that an association between the outcome variable and the explanatory chapter p page variable in the example at hand table this that there is an association between the outcome variable and the explanatory vari able hypertension in general the association between the outcome and the exposure is studied as it in table here the outcome variable is illness with the and affected and the explanatory variable is exposure with the exposed and exposed let p p affected be the unknown probability among the non exposed and p p affected among the exposed the association between outcome and explanatory variable is given in table statistical table association between the outcome variable and the explanatory variable outcome p p affected p p the null hypothesis association between illness and exposure is tested h p p against the alternative ha p p the statistical test is based on the in the cross table and exposure and the form in table the comparison binomial is in box table association between the outcome variable and the explanatory variable outcome aba p page example in table for the association between and hypertension and p p chapter box comparison of two binomial the two unknown are as from the theory it that when p p the stan dard error estimator is the normal distribution the binomial distribution so it that is approximately standard normally distributed i e the location is and the standard deviation is note that the size of the difference between p and p since we compare the difference with the random given by the standard error again the test statistic estimate standard error the basis for testing the value as the starting point for testing the hypothesis h and h is if p the normal distribution in statable is used se and p page moreover and which consequently from the statable for the normal distribution p z which that there is a significant association p between and hypertension the following will show that the p value corresponding to the z statistic is tical to the chi squared test statistic and in practice the more general s chi squared test statistic is used to test hypotheses in two binomial chi squared test the idea s test statistic is to compare the number of in each cell with the let the number in cell i j be the number be then the test in box may be written the last expression is the square root s chi squared test statistic that is used to test the assertion that illness is independent this to the general see box n e z se p statistical p page example in the data file the association between and hypertension was tested with for two the result was z with a p value of p z in this case and so there is r c degree the chi squared test in the given in table chapter table s test statistic for the association between coronary heart disease and elevated systolic blood pressure chi square in table and sig that the calculation p value is based on the approximation to a normal distribution the s chi squared test statistic is equal to the square z value resulting from the case and the p are the same in both there is degree as accordingly it box s chi squared test statistic a test statistic for the null hypothesis association can be based on the difference between the and cell the following test statistic is used in the above equation and this test statistic is s chi squared test statistic the distribution on the number in the table w the number of freedom as r c where the number and the number now let the value be h is if p the p value for an value corresponding to r c is found from statable oe p page can be that we may use the chi squared test in all to find p in tables tables of association in tables the between illness and exposure are based on the occur among the exposed and non exposed and various are defined below an effect measure can be defined by examining either the relation ship between or or or the difference between them as noted is identical to let and denote the effect based on the tables absolute risk reduction and its confidence interval the absolute risk reduction see box is defined as p note that two exposure are so that the risk difference the difference between the exposed and the non exposed box absolute risk reduction the absolute risk reduction is by the standard error found from the above evolve from the theory section in the customary manner the confidence interval for is found from se se p page example when we want an estimate absolute reduction heart disease among people with elevated to those with normal systolic blood pressure the above give an risk reduction of or the standard error estimate is se which in turn a confidence interval for risk reduction of the confidence interval does not include zero so we know that the p value the null hypothesis will be less than in it may sometimes be useful to report the the number to treat which is the reciprocal absolute risk reduction that is it the number who need to be to prevent one bad outcome a large treatment effect leads to a small relative risk and its confidence interval the relative risk see box is defined as the ratio of being affected among exposed and non exposed p the relative risk is based on the in table as a transformation is to calculate the confidence interval for this is because the relative risk does not follow a normal distribution but is skewed in this case a logarithmic transformation is used p page example again we analyse the association between and hyper tension in table by relative risk as the effect measure the is and the standard error is se statistical box relative risk the relative risk is as the standard error be calculated as the confidence interval is as usual provided by the theory normal distribution namely by its interval se the inverse transformation back the exponential function in the confidence interval for being se se p page hence the above equation the confidence interval for as the relative risk is calculated as this result that high elevated systolic blood pressure the risk heart disease by almost a factor of and that the true unknown value risk ratio in this case is likely to be within the interval may be used to compute the and the confidence interval the are shown in table the result with that manually and the confidence interval is again chapter table relative risk for the association between coronary heart disease and elevated systolic blood pressure relative risk for evidence odds ratio and the confidence interval as its name the odds ratio or is the ratio between two of odds in turn odds may be defined as the ratio the affected to the probability healthy odds are calculated both for exposed people and for non expose d people from table the odds for exposed people are p p while the odds for non exposed are p p the odds ratio is the ratio exposed to the non exposed that is note that this is the cross product in table thus or is by the cross in table the result is an odds ratio of p page as for the risk ratio in the confidence interval for or a logarithmic transformation is used box statistical box odds ratio the odds ratio is as the standard error is the confidence interval or is as usual provided by the theory normal distribution namely by its interval se the inverse transformation back to via the exponential function in the confidence interval for or being se se l in the table between and hypertension the estimate is and the standard error estimate is se or p page by entering and inverse transforming the confidence interval for or is this that excessive systolic blood pressure the odds nary heart disease by a factor to one and that the confidence interval is this with the result produced by in table chapter table odds ratio or between coronary heart disease and elevated systolic blood pressure odds ratio for evidence thus far the focus been on the computational three effect absolute risk reduction relative risk and odds ratio the first apart from the other two because it an absolute difference although much been written about absolute and relative confusion about these in particular for a rare event it might be to report a relative effect instead absolute effect assume that an event among and among the absolute risk reduction is which is read as one percentage point the relative risk considerable effect since often treatment halves the risk event the relative risk then is an apparently large number despite a small change apparent on the can often be to in effect regardless effect measure chosen to be germane the must be assessed relative to initial and the must be interest likewise much been written about the choice between and or in part with divergent often the effect measure is spoken relative risk although the odds ratio actually is this is unfortunate particularly as it can create unnecessary confusion however the two yield mately the same for rare the analysis in this case an of and an or of the probability heart disease is small p page so the for and for or coincide the probability can be in cohort and cross sectional hence normally is used in such in case control are taken among and among healthy as the ratio between the and is given one cannot estimate the probability just the probability exposed then or is used as an effect measure however this is as or is often used regardless type involved the odds ratio simpler statistical analyses in more complex such as in logistic regression see section hence there are computational for the extensive use odds ratio however interpretation may be simpler so many prefer to use whenever possible normal distribution the normal distribution a key role in the the distribution is symmetrical and its form is by its location and its variation standard deviation the location is by the symbol and the variation by the symbol is the standard deviation and the variance a normal distribution of location and variance x n the shape normal distribution is determined by its location on the x axis and the width distribution in principle an infinite number is possible when are con so it is no longer possible to compute the instead one may compute the probability for a variable lying within an interval or being less than a given value for example for variable measured value a one may compute p for this purpose the concept density is the probability density is by a curve and under the curve correspond to the probability variable less than p and to the left of a the entire area under the curve is unity then as the th percentile if p the th percentile is often the lower quartile the th percentile the median and the th percentile the upper quartile the distance is the difference between the lower and upper and it distribution statistical p page many statistical are based on the assumption that the data follow a normal distribution this assumption is checked a normality plot that whether the data approximately follow a normal distribution now we look more closely at the location distribution with a confidence interval when the data follow a normal distribution in a statistical experiment as of the data x x a normal distribution a location and a variance the mean of the x is calculated the distribution of x will also be normal with a location at but with a variance of n and therefore x n n this that the distribution average the same loca but with a variance of single observation the empirical variance is given by and sis used as the estimator for the standard deviation accordingly the loca normal distribution is as the mean and the standard error mean may be written this the relationship between the standard error mean and the standard deviation are interested in the distribution individual data as might be the case in the uncertainty or in ing the variation in we will be concerned with the magnitude of s however are interested in the location distribution the is of interest because it the uncertainty mean note that the confidence interval box is approximate as it is based on the normal distribution and not on the t distribution which is in section for small n the confidence interval based on the t distribution section is more accurate se chapter p page example a descriptive analysis mean systolic blood pressure data file as it is produced by is in table statistical box confidence interval of the mean x is the estimate of which is the true unknown location distribution because x a normal distribution an approximate interval for the location distribution is x x is by and which point to the and normal distribution this that the confidence interval the location distribution with probability the in the normal distribution can be found by the statable application table descriptive analysis systolic blood pressure mean confidence interval for mean lower bound upper bound mean median variance standard deviation minimum maximum range range se standard error in this table the location distribution is at the variance is and the standard deviation is the standard error p page is this is the the study n data so and the approximate confidence interval is this closely the listed in table the confidence interval this way may deviate from that in tables when not large because tables are based on t comparison of the t are often used to compare they were first in by w s who wrote under the pseudonym student so the approach is often to as student s t one type of t test is used to draw on the mean group one sample and another type of t test is used to compare the two such as two same patient may be by treating them as a single sample between two t a data set randomly selected from a normal distribution at with a standard deviation let x be the mean and let s standard error of x the test statistic is based on effect estimate standard error so in this case we seek p and to find it we need to know the dis of t the test statistic a student s t distribution with n of freedom there are many t the t distribution selected on the number or more precise ly the number it is known that x a normal distribution and that the difference between the nor mal distribution and the t distribution is that for the latter the standard deviation is as unknown and is by s the two may differ the t distribution is symmetrical and bell shaped as is the normal distribution but it as the number the t distribution more closely the normal distribution the difference between the two is negligible for about or more the statable application may be used to find p for a given well as in the t distribution for various chapter p page the percentile in a t distribution with is of result in a percentile of as that is nearly the percentile normal distribution in this case the t distribution can be by a normal distribution two t test the one sample test and the two sample test are now the one sample test is used for paired t testa principal application one sample t test is for such as the over see chapter or the comparison before and after a treatment for instance the null hypothesis to be tested can be h the mean before treatment the mean after treatment the alternative hypothesis can then be ha the before and after treatment differ in practice the difference d is calculated between two patient and the result tested to see whether it is compatible with the assertion that the difference is zero box the null hypothesis can then be expressed as h the location distribution of dis statistical box paired t test statistic is based on the mean between the for the individual by d instead of x to indicate clearly that we are dealing with a paired situation under the null hypothesis the mean value difference is and the test statistic may be written p page example have that some calcium may interact with juice apparently intake juice leads to drug concentration in plasma is the case the result may be a more pronounced effect and a greater risk effects assume that a trial is with n who on one occasion take the drug with water and on another occasion take it with a measured quan juice the maximum plasma concentration drug is measured in l the shown in table are from a hypothetical trial that nonetheless is plausible as it previously the data file is accessible at chapter table plasma concentration antagonist taken with and without grapefruit juice this test statistic is t distributed with n for a particular value test statistic the null hypothesis may be p value is p statable or such as may be used to compute this p value p page the mean difference is d and the standard deviation is we test whether the mean difference is compatible with the null hypothesis by statable is used to find the p value as n there are n for a t value of and eight the p so we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that simultaneous intake juice the maximum concentration antagonist in plasma this problem can easily be with a paired t test the are shown in tables and t statistical table drug concentration intake with grapefruit juice minus intake without difference the calcium antagonist and without intake juice are for each person by taking their as shown in table table descriptive analysis of grapefruit juice water standard deviation standard error mean p page chapter from table the mean difference is and the standard error is this a t statistic of by dividing the mean by the standard error with a corresponding p value of note that in the p value is for a two sided alternative box effect measure for paired the mean difference is the natural effect measure in this case hence we must find the confidence interval for the true difference as given by the equation which can be where d is the mean difference standard deviation and as before the number the constant t n is the percentile in the t distribution n as found statable semsem table single sample t test for grapefruit juice water p page example in the previous example the mean difference is d as there are t a confidence interval then is lated to be the interval does not include zero and consequently to a sis test that in rejection null hypothesis as seen in table this confidence interval is the same as that found two independent one most common statistical analyses is the comparison inde pendent see box in these we wish to find whether there is a difference in the two let the two be and it is assumed that the two are independent and follow normal it is also assumed that the standard two are the same and as usual equal to now one may test the null hypothesis h there is no difference between the that is against the two sided alternative ha the differ that is statistical box testing in the two sample situation assume that the two respectively comprise n and n the are x and x the test statistic which is the ratio between the effect estimate and its standard error is p page example we wish to determine whether there is a difference between the and total prostate specific antigen in with can prostate cap and those with benign prostate hyperplasia the to total are measured in a small sample of n cap and n the data as listed in table are from the study file at chapter table percentage free total in with cancer prostate cap and with benign prostate hyperplasia where sis the estimate standard deviation two expressed by p page now we test the null hypothesis h there is no difference between the mean free total two that is against the two sided alternative ha there is a difference between the mean free total two that is in this example the mean free total is x for cap for the standard are as s and s respectively an estimate standard deviation is are and statable is used to find that p may also be used to analyse the data as shown in tables and in the analysis the two are assumed to have the same variance which is credible on the basis descriptive analysis the are thus read from the first row equal assumed and the p value for the two sided alternative is found to be p accordingly it may be that the ratio between free and total in serum is higher in with than those with cap there is however more information in t statistical p page chapter table descriptive analysis total prostate specific antigen cap cap cancer prostate benign prostate hyperplasia table two sample t test for free total equal assumed equal not assumed p page statistical table the assumption is assessed by s test given by f in this case the resulting p value is and we do not reject the hypothesis this further reading from the line equal assumed p value from s test is below one should use the line equal not assumed box effect measure and confidence interval the effect measure for the difference between the two is x x this is a plausible effect measure as it the difference between the a confidence interval for the difference is the t n n constant is found from statable for a t distribution with n n in the example above the difference between the is and the standard error mean difference is the constant is t the in box a confidence interval for the true difference is p page chapter non parametric the in section are based on the assumption that the data follow a normal distribution and for the two sample situation on the that the have the same variance following a normal distribution are a normality plot the assumption the same variance can be checked by a descriptive analysis or more formally by s test two alternative are available for in which the data do not follow a normal distribution a set may be so that it approximately a normal distribution or non parametric may be used the need for transformation whenever the distribution are than those normal distribution a logarithmic transformation is most often used non parametric are also used as below note however that non parametric are as intolerant as the t test to from the assumption variance effect measure in non parametric the mean set is a sensible estimator location whenever the data completely or approximately follow a normal distribution however the mean is excessively by extreme the median is a more appropriate effect measure whenever a distribution is skewed or the data con tain extreme this is because the median is not by extreme for a symmetrical distribution the mean and the median are the same non parametric should be used whenever the do not approximately follow a normal distribution often such are used only for statistical testing and not for the effect measure that said we will show how the confidence interval may be found for median in non parametric s rank test s rank test is the most commonly used test for paired see box p page statistical example consider the same example as that one sample t test in tables and the absolute paired are in ascending rank order thereafter rank are added up for the positive or the negative accordingly the test statistic is tor t the ordered in ascending absolute value are shown in table table ranked in intake with grapefruit juice minus intake without absolute difference sign rank the sum for negative is t and the sum rank for positive is t let the test statistic the p value is found from table at or from tables in statistics such as or the table for n that the lower limit is and the upper limit is as our test statistic outside this range it may be con that the effect juice is statistically significant p when there are more than the rank sum is well by a normal distribution the expectation and standard deviation of tare box s test for paired comparison calculate the difference for each pair the absolute paired are in ascending rank order the are added up for the positive or the negative find the p from table at p page chapter in the example e t and t the test statistic is equal to the difference between the value that is and the value divided by the standard deviation which is which a two sided p value of the data also may be in the are shown in tables and the in table correspond to those both exact and approximate sig z here the non parametric test led to the same conclusion as that t test this that the that is the approximately follow a normal distribution in this case the information in the data are in the the dis we wish to find a confidence interval for the median dis there are several ways to compute the median and the confidence interval see box here the procedure is used first the are ranked by magnitude table for the positive and negative of negative a positive b awater grapefruit juice grapefruit juice juice water table test statistic and p value for s test for paired comparison z sig tailed abased on positive p page statistical then the calculated in the above example there are nine that result in such w w w w w w w w w w w w finally the median is calculated an effect estimate of is found which in this example with the median however that will not be the case when there are identical or among the which result in zero accordingly the previous method is preferable example the confidence interval is found from table we rank all for n the critical are and so choose the value of rank ordered mean number corresponding to w and number corresponding to w we find an approximate confidence interval of box effect measure and confidence interval calculate the difference for each pair and sort them in increasing order calculate the mean as in the text arrange the paired in increasing order calculate the median the effect estimate calculate the confidence interval in the effect estimate such as from table at two independent the mann test this test many s two sample test s rank sum test and mann u test see box the null hypothesis to be tested is h the two are from the same distribution and the alternative hypothesis is ha the two are from two that have the same shape but there is a shift in location p page chapter the mann test was made for when there is a pure shift in location between the while this setting is ideal the test may also be used in more general to look more closely at the test let the number in group be n group n the total number then is n the can be plotted in ranked order so the to which they belong are obvious thereafter rank are assigned to the similar w for the two indicate that the null hypothesis is true a rank sum for one that is considerably higher or lower than that the alternative hypothesis is true the critical depend on the choice of significance level and probability distribution of the null hypothesis example a trial to examine the effect treatment included migraine were given psychological treatment relaxation training and a control group each patient to an audio tone that progressively in volume to the level discomfort that level was registered a low score that a patient little noise the study are shown in table the data are replicated from al and are found in the score file the for the two differ considerably table there is a trend towards lower in the control group than in the group null hypothesis is true the rank two should be similar because the are equally large assume that the control group rank sum of w as the test statistic the rank sum is w is this sum small to reject the null hypothesis the answer can be found in table or in statistical such as or we enter the table box mann test for two independent rank for both together calculate the rank sum for one find the p value from table at p page statistical for n n and find a lower limit of and an upper limit of our test statistic outside this range so p and h is an alternative approach to finding p is to approximate the rank sum distribution with a normal distribution usually exact tables cover only up to n n so an approximation to a normal distribution must be used for higher unless relevant statistical is used the approximation is considered good when n and n the rank sum under h is and the standard deviation is when we divide the difference between the and rank by the standard deviation we find a test statistic z table sound level score as uncomfortable p page chapter this p which is found in the statable for the normal distribution also may be used to perform this analysis in which case the are as shown in tables and these correspond to those above assume that the application two independent one and one untreated we wish to find the median difference between the two first all possible pairwise in the group minus in the untreated group are calculated then the are table ranked sound as uncomfortable a a w w average rank value is assigned to coincident p page statistical ranked and the median difference is found box the confidence interval can be found from table box effect measure and confidence interval calculate the difference for all possible one observation from each group rank the in ascending order calculate the median the effect estimate calculate the confidence interval for the effect estimate such as from table at example considering the same case as that previous example we will late we rank all the calculated and find their median to be as for s test for paired comparison a table is used to find the confidence interval the starting point is table for n n the lower limit observation is number and the upper limit observation is number then a confidence interval is table rank for the control group and the treatment group treatment total table test statistic and p value for mann test mann u w z sig tailed p page chapter regression analysis regression analysis between one outcome vari able and one or more exposure for an overview see table in chapter here we will look closer at linear logistic and regression analyses for the when the outcome variable is measured via continuous nominal or count data respectively in regression analysis are commonly as dependent and explanatory rather than outcome and exposure or independent linear regression linear regression analysis the study between two assumed to be continuous see table the relationship is assumed to be linear that is a straight line in the slope intercept form where the explanatory and dependent variable data are to be fitting the slope intercept equation although the have an additional randomness or noise this is expressed by a term to the slope intercept equation is the intercept the slope and the randomness or noise in this interpretation the do not lie on a straight line but rather deviate from it owing to individual again consider the data as an example now we will look at the relation between systolic blood pressure cholesterol level age and smoking the relation between systolic blood pressure and cholesterol level cholesterol is shown in figure the relation between the is shown in the plotted and a regression line been drawn through them for a given value of x there is a yon the regression line given by the equation this value is the value the difference between the and the corresponding value is the residual as can be seen from the figure the are relatively large this that the p page statistical randomness or noise is considerable which in turn that the individual are large and the question as to whether other than the independent variable chosen may influence the dependent regression coefficient now we will find the line that best the we choose a linear fit serum cholesterol mean systolic blood pressure figure association between systolic blood pressure and cholesterol level box least regression line there are of xi and x and y denote the and the the intercept and slope are by p page chapter see box note that and represent unknown and from the data and the interpretation is below example we continue the data in the regression analysis the least method is used to find the line that the best fit to the shown in figure it the association between as the dependent variable and cholesterol as the explanatory variable in a regression analysis the are given in table and is the constant and is the regression coefficient both and may be calculated manually but they are far more easily calculated a statistical program package table regression analysis blood pressure with respect to cholesterol level constant cholesterol e the regression analysis constant and the regression coefficient cholesterol level in the regression analysis for cholesterol and an interpretation constant term is usually interest in a regression analysis this is because the value of x in this example when cholesterol is irrelevant in the analysis the analysis that by when cholesterol by unit scales must be in regression p page statistical with respect to each other as a one unit change in a particular vari able may differ from a one unit change in another variable regression coefficient testing and confidence interval the p and confidence resulting from regression analyses require to be independent and to have the same variance which must be is no association between the dependent and the independent that is the variance is from the around the mean that is this is the same measure as in section between the that is the regression coefficient is no longer zero the estimate variance is based on around the regression line instead from the mean that is is now used as the estimator for in this case the denominator is n instead again this is practical importance so it is not further box confidence interval of regression coefficient the estimator for the regression coefficient is given in box the standard error regression coefficient is this standard error is essential as its magnitude the length of the confidence interval it is tabulated in the se column se p page chapter example the data comprise n the standard error regression coefficient between and was found above we use t from statable to calculate the confidence interval for the regression coefficient but as there are so many the percentile for the t distribution and the percentile for the normal distribution coincide that is t hence the interval for the regression coefficient with regard to cho is based on box and table the confidence interval regression coefficient is as usual the value oft n is found from statable in its t distribution with n number is large t n se se table regression analysis blood pressure with respect to cholesterol level constant cholesterol e when the regression coefficient the relationship between the depend variable the explanatory variable will be given by a straight line to the x axis this that there is no association between x while a positive association and a negative association hence we wish to find whether there is an association between x so we put forth the null hypothesis h p page statistical and the alternative hypothesis h box test of the hypothesis that the regression coefficient is zero the hypothesis that there is no relation between the dependent and inde pendent is tested with the test statistic the value of h is if p t se to the example data file the relation ship between systolic blood pressure and cholesterol level cho can be as in table in table the confidence interval is which with the manual calculation above moreover the t value is with a corresponding p value so table the information in this case the above example a between the dependent variable and one explanatory variable but most often a single explanatory variable is an oversimplification in a regression model as usually several explanatory are other may include explanatory such as gender age and other demographic an association between the depend variable and an explanatory variable may be due to covariation with other explanatory even in on the effect specific exposure variable a regression model must also include other relevant explanatory these other explanatory may be as control or confounding used to verify the effect regardless aim regression analysis the procedure for extending a regression model to several explanatory is known as a multiple regression p page chapter model the regression are again calculated the least method however the manual are complicated and will con sequently not be further here hence the description is confined by writ ing the relation between the dependent variable the as y x x the regression as p let two tory be x x and x x hence the difference in the is x x x x p consequently is as the change dependent variable by a unit change of x when x x constant in other is the effect when we have for x x the other regression are in the same manner example to the example data file with systolic blood pressure as the dependent variable and cholesterol age and smoke as the explanatory which in this case might be exposure we find the given in table table regression analysis blood pressure with respect to cholesterol level age and smoking status constant cholesterol e age smoking status from table the multiple regression model are by and large the same as those simple regression analysis for cholesterol level when for age and smoking the effect cholesterol level negligibly from to the analysis may be as a variety analysis is used when the explanatory variable is categorical regression p page statistical analysis may also be used in with categorical explanatory so with categorical explanatory one may choose either or regression analysis logistic regression whenever the dependent variable is categorical the plot relation between the dependent variable and the explanatory variable from the between two continuous is the categorical variable in the file is plotted against me in figure mean systolic blood pressure evidence of relation between coronary heart disease and elevated systolic blood pressure the plot may indicate that the probability heart disease with increasing blood pressure as there is a tendency toward more s at higher blood but this may admittedly be hard to see from the figure the relationship with a dependent variable that only the or is expressed as the probability dependent variable the value in a p page non linear function explanatory variable the function usually used to express this relation is the logistic which is the root term logistic sion analysis to interpret the of and we transform the equation for p x and cal the odds p x p x hence which is log odds or as the log odds is linear in and they are read the interpretation of is the log odds for x but this is practical importance so its value is almost never used because the value tell us how much the log odds for y when by one unit it is more amenable to interpret as a change in odds from the above equation which that when by one unit the odds change by the value the effect measure logistic regression analysis as it the degree between the explanatory variable and the dependent variable the value of used to interpret the relationship example we use logistic regression to analyse the association between and data the are shown in table e chapter p page statistical note that b in table is the odds ratio we use for of the here the regression coefficient is e and the confidence inter val for this that the odds for coronary heart disease increase by a factor of for each increase in systolic blood pressure we see that the confidence interval in this case is calculated to be box confidence interval for the regression there are of xi of and may be found so the data best the logistic function the likelihood for what is this is the maximum likelihood method a pro gram for logistic regression such as maximum likelihood and and the associated standard se and se the confidence interval for is found in the customary manner by the with the standard error se the estimator very nearly a normal distribution provided there are sufficient data so in the usual manner we have an approximate confidence interval for through transforming via an exponential function we find a interval for se se se se table logistic regression heart disease with respect to systolic blood pressure mean constant p page chapter now we wish to test the null hypothesis that there is no association between x so we put forth a null hypothesis h that against the alternative hypothesis box box test of the hypothesis that the regression coefficient is zero the test hypothesis association is in the usual way by the effect estimate with that standard error the following test statistic is used the value of h is if p t se note that some such as calculate not t but rather which is the statistic whether t is used instead of immaterial with respect to calculating the p example we revert to the and find that which with the result above analysis save a small rounding off error we find a p value than t se p page statistical as above an n between the dependent variable and an explanatory variable might be due to association with other explanatory the effect explanatory variable for other may be studied multiple logistic regression assume in general that there are and that the logistic regression model may be expressed this expression is equivalent to for two explanatory variable x x and x x the difference in the log odds is x x x x p consequently is as the change log odds by one unit change in x when x x constant it is often said that is the effect when we have for x x the other regression are in the same manner again the effects are via in odds not via log odds when x by unit and the other explanatory are constant the odds for y change by e the for the other explanatory vari are similar example the data file with coronary heart disease as the dependent variable and systolic blood pressure cholesterol level cholesterol age age and smoking smoke as the explanatory we find the tabulated in table the effect blood pressure is approximately the same for the as for the simple logistic regression analysis but there is also an effect of cholesterol level and age p page chapter regression in clinical and epidemiological the effect measure is often based on the incidence rate as in chapter a useful measure is the ratio incidence among the exposed and the non exposed a feasible way to study an incidence rate is to assume that the total number a distribution now let the number incidence rate and length up time or observation time then we write that y it to signify that a distribution with mean it the estimator for the incidence rate i y t this is the estimator in chapter as for the relative risk and the odds ratio we have to transform to a logarithmic scale to estimate the standard error the standard error i is y are two one exposed and one non exposed with incidence i eye i y t the confidence interval for ie i is as stated in section as for linear and logistic regression we may wish to control for several explanatory when the explanatory are categorical the incidence rate is constant or nearly so within each category and the model is the most analytical tool in general there are x x and the regression model then may be expressed by y x x t where x x x x is the incidence rate is the total length up time as usual is the constant term and table logistic regression heart disease with respect to systolic blood pressure cholesterol level age and smoking mean cholesterol age smoking status constant p page statistical p are the regression regression model consider two people with explanatory x x and x x the is is the change in incidence rate for a change in x when x by one unit and the are constant the change in incidence is e an application program for general linear such as can be used to find and confidence for the s example table may be regression let smoking be the explanatory variable with two a generalized linear model for analysis with one explanatory variable namely smoking the are as shown in table table regression analysis incidence rate relative to smoking constant smoking the analysis are on a logarithmic scale so the incidence rate is and these correspond to those calculated manually in section practical statistics for medical research chapman hall al data texas a m university study college station

practice and critical appraisal of systematic liv and peter m bradley introduction evidence based practice or evidence based is an approach to decision making which research information clinical and and it can be defined in this way evidence based medicine or health care clinical as the to integrate patient research evidence and patient prefer to help arrive at optimal diagnostic and treatment al evidence based or evidence informed practice the importance of research based evidence in decision making however it is not the intention that research evidence should replace professional and experience or deny on the contrary evidence based practice that only by clinical and listening to can research be applied in clinical practice or policy making the five classically in are listed in box p page this chapter on the third and fourth they are about the critical appraisal literature and about the in real life that said there are many why do not act on research evidence research on implementation in practice the most common are that do not have time there are insufficient to change behaviour do not have the right or knowledge about they lack support from and they are unable to access ate valid research evidence ironically the fact that are each week can also be a barrier for many who experience an information overflow can be a good way to make information more accessible and to address the information overflow sum up the from several research on the same topic and therefore make the easier to access however a review is not enough to implement evidence informed practice to influence behaviour are to ensure that the are made available and to the appropriate target audience within the health service systematic the aim review is to combine the from individual in one paper or report many do not use a systematic method for combing their and may give an unbalanced picture research for one particular issue or question in systematic the use an explicit and systematic method to search for critically appraise and combine the from individual chapter box the five in define a clearly defined clinical or research question search for the evidence search the literature for relevant critically appraise the evidence for its validity and usefulness implement useful in clinical practice evaluate the practice or what you have decided to do when appropriate p page on the topic as by peter morgan former scientific editor canadian medical association journal the medical literature can be to a jungle it is fast growing full of dead wood sprinkled with hidden treasure and with and this chapter will concentrate on systematic based on that answer about the effectiveness in in other that aim to answer such as does this treatment work or does this prevention intervention or this rehabilitation intervention work what is the effect treatment does it cause any harm the majority those in the library see section review these the process that you to decide whether or not research is valid is appraisal it been as critical appraisal is the evaluation of a piece research usually a paper in a professional journal by that address design and methodology data analysis presentation and relevance there are three main for a research paper the fail to tell you what the paper is about they have not stated a clear research question the might have used a research method that leads to bias a system error or deviation in or from the truth are owing to how the their piece you cannot trust the the methodological quality piece is the internal validity see section the from it are not relevant and applicable for your practice your lation or your own piece the way in which the from a study are used in practice is the external validity or research in the rest chapter a paper is critically and one example from a systematic review petrie is used evidence based practice and critical appraisal of systematic p page critical appraisal of a systematic review one section will critically appraise a systematic review petrie a that can help to appraise the quality review the are taken from the by the critical appraisal to help you make sense free in a file from critical appraisal this is in turn based on a from to the medical literature choosing evidence e the evidence available from please read the scenario in box before moving on chapter box scenario for and jet lag some have you they are going away to a conference in australia from and have read that taking might help to prevent and treat jet lag you have this too and as you are internationally across time this year you are interested to know more about it in the library you find a review petrie that apparently may provide to two relevant is effective in and treating jet lag should you use were long distance have access to the library please find the review and take the time to read the paper now when you have done so answer the two in box after you have been through the whole chapter you can address the again and see whether you have your mind critically appraising a paper main first you should con sider whether the review is worth spending time on the two first we will consider are therefore screening and did the review ask a clearly question did the review include the right type p page only can answer yes to both these it is worth to read the review more closely secondly you need to judge whether the review are valid by considering the scientific methodology review after this you should look at the review and finally look at to see whether the can realistically be applied in the real world screening did the review ask a clearly question consider whether the question is in of the population studied the intervention given or exposure the considered for any research paper we read we need to know the question a paper on the effectiveness intervention should define a question in study population the intervention and the considered in the paper the to the question on population intervention and are stated in the and in the following paragraph criteria for considering for this review in the it that the aim is to evaluate whether taken by mouth can prevent or alleviate jet lag associated with air travel across several time the review also the evidence for the effectiveness dosage in particular the timing in relation to the flight and to the day night cycle at the destination the inclusion criteria for this systematic review are stated under criteria for considering for this review were included oral with non active treatment placebo or other medication taken before during and or after medication more detail is given under the heading were included were military personnel oral the intervention could be taken before during and or after travel the evidence based practice and critical appraisal of systematic p page primary the self rating lag the review stated that they were interested in the following secondary fatigue day time tiredness onset at n onset and quality psychologic al duration to normal and the phase it that a clear question was by the review and it is did the review include the right type of study consider whether the included address the review s question have an appropriate study design as stated a review can in theory include design however the included must be appropriate to answer the type of question box es those commonly and the appropriate type design to answer them more than one study design can be used for any question and box is only meant for guidance see also table in chapter chapter box which study design is appropriate for different of study study design why do some get a disease while stay well causation what is the probability that the problem on the course will resolve by itself condition prognosis cohort case control how can we decide whether someone on the accuracy of a specific condition diagnostic diagnosis could this problem or condition be p page to consider whether and petrie had included the right sort of in their paper we need to refer once more to the review s inclusion and exclusion criteria under it that were included the same information is also given in the abstract under selection criteria they also for of suspected adverse effects of that were not in the but these were not included in the main analysis randomization in practice that the in the trial all have an equal chance active or control this regardless external factor e g age gender motivation to participate in the study or previous experience distance travel in other successful random that the and other that might influence the or are equally distributed between the and the result study is not by the extent to which these are known to the researcher non can lead to the charac and other are not equally distributed between the this evidence based practice and critical appraisal of systematic what should i do to treat this condition is there anything we can do to speed up on the effects of recovery intervention how does the person feel or experience on this condition qualitative how many people have this condition on prevalence is this intervention or exposure harmful on harm and cohort case control herbert al p page imbalance might in the trial for example in a non trial with where the were with placebo could have previous serious lag the could knowingly or unknowingly have more to the placebo group detailed about internal validity did the try to identify all relevant consider which bibliographic were used whether there was a follow up from reference whether there was personal contact with whether the for unpublished whether the for non english language one main in a systematic review is to give the reader a full and bal overview on all available research on one issue it is therefore necessary that systematic are based on a thorough search literature and give a bal overview found this is a big challenge one biggest bibliographic within medical research more than but still less than a fifth total number relevant to medicine and in addition many are not indexed in data bases and many are never it can therefore be problematic only concentrate on indexed in the biggest available a phenomenon known as publication bias in and petrie s review the search strategy are given in the section search strategy for identification the for and unpublished by searching and by the were the register now central and they the science citation index to identify that had the they two aviation space and environmental medicine and sleep from to and they also considered conference chapter p page there further were in the citation for relevant the also state which search they used jet lag jet lag aviation air travel moreover the for on adverse effects that were not in the in the above it that the for literature up to the review was in and further were included then but the do not state how they for literature at that point generally speaking it that the did a good job in relevant did the assess the quality of the included consider whether a clear strategy was used to determine which were included look for a scoring system more than one assessor the systematic review should first exclude the primary that did not meet the inclusion criteria as stated in the protocol the should then critically appraise all the they have left in inter and the external validity individual study and the since critical appraisal is partly a subjective process it is good practice that this selection is done independently by two people should use a valid which been and truly the quality study there are many available can be used together with locally that address importance to the review more on and critical appraisal are included in the bibliography at the end chapter in the systematic review on the effects the state in the section that they undertook a quality assessment included quality assessment allocation concealment and blinding was for and used in the are ant their relevance validity and reproducibility evidence based practice and critical appraisal of systematic p page the used standard criteria to critically appraise con related to allocation concealment and blinding they also whether had measured the in the valid if the of the have been combined was it reasonable to do so consider whether the study are clearly displayed the were similar from study to study look for the for any in are the systematic review can decide whether to describe the from included as a narrative each study in turn alternatively they can numerically combine the for each outcome a meta analysis a meta analysis should only be individual are similar enough homogeneous to make clinical sense i e similar inter and are considered whether are sufficiently homogeneous can be assessed two main first by individual and secondly by statistical the first method leads to a subjective and clinical are similar enough to combine in a meta analysis the second method potential heterogeneity for example unexplained variation in the from the individual that is where seem to differ from the overall and require further investigation and petrie a meta analysis they had included the justification for combining these and excluding was that these four had used a global visual analogue jet lag score to measure the three used a dosage of and one study used there was also some difference in the way the were instructed to use the however the were consistent in the four so it reasonable to combine the from the four in a meta analysis as in figure the a statistical t for heterogeneity which whether it was reasonable from a statistical point to combine the chapter p page evidence based practice and critical appraisal

mean mean difference fixed weighted mean difference fixed treatment control figure meta analysis of comparison versus placebo source the library john sons p page further information on statistical on testing for heterogeneity is pro by egger al and green how are the and what is the main result consider how the are expressed e g effect such as odds ratio relative risk how large the effect is and how meaningful it is how you would sum up the bottom line result review in one sentence there are many ways in which to express the from individual and meta analyses roughly there are two the first type is categorical ordinal outcome data and the case is when you can answer a question with a simple yes or no for example the jet lag got better or not such data are also dichotomous the other main category is continuous data that measure relative for example measuring improvement lag on a visual scale see also section when dichotomous are used the effect measure can be expressed as a ratio or an absolute difference a ratio the risk happening against it not happening e g incidence rate ratio relative risk or risk ratio alternatively the effect measure is an absolute risk reduction an absolute difference is used when one result is from another e g absolute risk reduction the most usual way to compare continuous data in a meta analysis is based on subtraction result from another the can be calculated as weighted mean difference were measured in the same way in the individual or standardized weighted mean difference were measured differently in the individual you can read more about how to express in chapter in this book and in the handbook the overall in the meta analysis for versus placebo are lated as a weighted mean difference by combining the data from all the individual to give an overall score as a diamond in figure there are two statistical for calculating effects fixed and random effects here the meta analysis used a fixed effect the individual are weighted chapter p page a method more weight to bigger with most to read more about fixed and random effects and analysis see egger al the overall result from the meta analysis on versus placebo is still less than that the result the use to treat jet lag it is worth that when such you need to bear in mind what type is being measured outcome had been the opposite considered in the jet lag i e how many people had to therapy the weighted mean difference would have been greater than how precise are these consider whether a confidence interval is would your decision about whether or not to use this intervention be the same at the upper confidence limit as at the lower confidence limit whether a p value is where confidence are unavailable in the comparison above versus placebo figure the in the mean difference is shown as a confidence interval the confidence interval into account whether the positive effect on jet lag could be due to random chance rather than any real effect roughly speaking there is a probability of that the effect in the range by the confidence interval when you look at the forest plot in figure you can see the confidence inter for each trial as horizontal going through the point estimate in two of the the confidence interval the vertical line line significance and numerically zero this that we do not know whether the treat ment had a beneficial or detrimental effect on jet lag this type is known as a non significant result however when the were to obtain an overall result the confidence interval does not cross the line significance this that the overall review result a clear reduction in the severity lag it is worth that the included in the meta analysis relatively few from to in for small are seen to be most at risk as they have the evidence based practice and critical appraisal of systematic p page biggest confidence in contrast the overall result from the meta analysis the confidence interval and hence the most precise result it a virtual study than any component can the be applied to the local population consider whether the population sample covered by the review could be different from your population in ways that would produce different your local setting much from that review you can provide the same intervention in your setting the systematic review the effect in different for jet lag after air travel across several time when considering on external validity on research as in question above it is an advantage that the have different that all show similar the were all on across six or more time mostly to or from or to or from the new or australia the covered both eastward and westward fly ing the were healthy both men and were included and the age range covered was there is limited additional information about the in the tables given in the review you might consider that the population sample is similar to your but be aware that we have no information on the ethnic social class or level the majority seem to have been or new your local set ting may be different note also that there are no that considered or old people nonetheless jet lag is a condition for people who travel across time and generally the review of that could help many quite apart from this you need to consider whether is available in your setting is not licensed and cannot be easily in most this is an obvious barrier to the review s chapter p page were all important considered consider from the point individual policy and family community the primary outcome considered was a self rating lag the also for fatigue daytime tiredness onset at destination quality psychological duration to normal and the phase as secondary nine report ed potential side effects but only three for systematically some in these tri lag daytime sleepiness dizziness headache and loss of appetite the discuss the effects on various this should help you to make an informed decision on the effect of the possibility effects needs to be balanced against the evidence for the positive effect on jet lag should policy or practice change as a result of the evidence in this review consider whether any benefit any harm and or cost is not can it be filled in from elsewhere the information on the effect the side effects is not complete the individual have not all relevant although the main question on subjective rating lag is well covered information from systematic will inevitably be limited as the can only base the on currently we have to consider whether the with which we were is sufficient to make an informed decision note that the review was last in it might be to check whether any new on for jet lag have been since then evidence based practice and critical appraisal of systematic p page turn back to the scenario and see whether you can decide on the therein does help for jet lag would you use were long distance have you your mind after read the review systematically the why have you your mind summary systematic can provide comprehensive transparent and valid that can help to answer specific clinical they are useful for anyone who by research information or who to invest precious time efficiently by reading high quality critically literature by appraising the individual included in have selected available high quality on a particular topic and lower quality research by a quantitative method from vidual in a meta analysis a more precise and convincing conclusion can be than from individual alone unfortunately systematic are quality however by critic ally appraising them accepted criteria poor can be and poor research evidence can promote ineffective and even harmful methodological quality should therefore not be used to support whether by the public and policy in contrast systematic

marked presentation related data as a consequence of the in cancer breast can be the surgeon markedly after she had of breast p page chapter overuse verb to be this short chapter excellent summary of is better written this short chapter excellently empty phrasing the fact is that it is clear that our falsify generally hypotheses perhaps could be simplified to indeed our falsify impersonal it it is possible that can be perhaps or possibly present participle with no subject dangling assaying the the that should be as the did not measure the assaying the we found that ordinary convoluted the experimental cell had a very rapid growth rate can be written grew more rapidly the for the test group were comparable to those for the control group perhaps should be similar to those long full far apart box structure title include the paper avoid and ponderous bose preferably state the type the experimental handled and the main method used p page scientific communication abstract why how and what was done or the summary abstract must not be too long maximum see to include only what you are certain about that is avoid doubt the summary should be informative not indicative do such as the will be in relation to the hypothesis after the abstract up to index preferably from mesh introduction presentation in two or three setting the topic in perspective background perhaps as a historical overview only what is to lead to the next point past tense refer readily to overview it should be clear what the point to approach purpose perhaps hypotheses to be tested precise put forth why the work is important maybe clarify the work progression and the summary you should answer the question why and order usually according to importance or in logical order starting with experimental or test and approval by relevant ethical species number gender food and drink maybe designate the time various or maybe see to for journal chosen manufacturer s name address and maybe batch number for logical donor s name provided by for a method previously cite for add what and why different p page chapter maybe a subsection with methodological the experimental set up must be so the can be replicated by competent in the field at hand and is a recipe book finish by giving an account statistical under the heading statistics summary you should answer the question how give a brief description in logical order do not repeat listed in tables or in but describe and such as with table or figure in parentheses preferably state how are such as about than the control no real discussion in the section but some and are often necessary you might start with a documentation valid or study set up state the uncertainty localization parameter and or the effect measure error mean median with a confidence interval now and then the variation width standard deviation coefficient or quartile interval is stated but often is better in and state the p number number preferably in connection with tables data normalization that is conversion to or mean in a control group such as to permit combining the of different without the variation taken too far with the same result one can now and then describe the course experiment and then say that the other four gave in principle the same result or maybe atypical result and the reason for it summary you should answer the question what did you find p page title should be short and specific it may be divided into two the second the first state the principal find or conclusion in the title it also to indicate the experimental used in an animal study or the used in clinical or other on some might be dendritic as effector gamma activation dendritic oxygen dependent inhibition of replication cytochrome and progression lateral sclerosis in mice is a clear title for a paper in nature pathogenesis the role of bone marrow stem and vascular endothelial is an informative title for a doctoral dissertation on the other hand active intestinal peptide as a in the axis the influence is not very good in part because it does not state that the work was on human try to avoid paltry such as the effect of or from if possible also avoid and and do not overburden the title with as in tobacco mosaic virus scientific communication discussion briefly point out the principal in relation to the approach introduction preferably several preferably with probability how reliable are the do they agree with the transfer value or why have no found this accurate maybe something on the for a successful result unanswered and future ending preferably in the form of in which you summarize what is most important put forth your own and preferably include item summary you should answer the question what do the mean p page long cell or growth from peripheral blood human progenitor abstract should be comprehensible without reference to the body text most read only the title and sometimes the abstract paper only those interested will continue to the tables introduction or maybe more you should start with the background purpose or principal problem continue with the principal then the most reliable and certain and finish with a popularly understood conclusion be sure to study the journal to which you will submit your paper and follow their style have the choice i believe that it is better not to include data or p in an abstract it should be obvious that you have not made which are not backed up by significant data repeatedly use unusual they should be defined upon first use for example the plasma concentration after after the abstract or alternatively on the title page manuscript in with the to include the or index not in the title preferably select from the medical subject mesh introduction the introduction should state the scientific problem and why it should be try to avoid obvious and in the first sen as regrettably often used in journal keep your audience in mind with a few introduce your theme and set it in perspective a short historical review may be suitable preferably with to overview here as elsewhere in the paper meticulously clearly and hon state the works it is all too easy to make several state by a reference that to support all although it only the last likewise here as elsewhere you should know the field sufficiently well to credit those who so deserve as most often it was they who made the chapter p page pretend that you are a storyteller spinning out a thread that is easily and leads to the what and the how you intend to do usually you should say something about the relevance project and about why the problem not been to your knowledge some end an introduction with a summary principal finding but i maintain that is so overly repetitious in the standard paper as to be unnecessary a suitable length for an introduction is one or two double spaced point type manuscript and again it is wise to study the style journal to which you will submit your paper this section is your handbook it will be read only by those especially interested in your topic use several to guide your reader to the to be further the human test or the experimental should be in the first paragraph test subject data gender age weight may be in a table or in a flow diagram that those enrolled inclusion and exclusion criteria written informed consent should be see and moreover any approval by an ethics committee must be stated the experimental should likewise be in gender weight or age food and drink and supplier s name and address and some times also by whether they are inbred or outbred specific pathogen free and by what here also ethic approval must be explicitly such as by that all animal were by the experimental animal board committee under the ministry of and in conformity with the european convention for the protection used for experimental and other scientific or a shorter version statement randomization must be stated for both man and mouse measured are subject to diurnal observation times should be stated the next subsection can have a subheading such as or biological it a listing preferably alphabetical used with the trade and their in parentheses such as scientific communication p page alternatively orion finland whenever the quality biological material you should state the batch lot or code number preparation used was a gift name the donor in parentheses kind gift from n n the institute and also thank him or her in the for previously name the procedure with a reference to its original description in short brief were with a density gradient method ref however as well as new should be in detail sufficient to enable other in the field to replicate the remember to state all essential chemical such as temperature c is preferable to room preferably in si system such as l gas pressure solution volume storage data preferable to per minute it may be practical to include a section on experimental design in which you describe the course trial or experiment further you may allow section methodological in which you put forth of methodological research germane to y our and which you prefer not to disturb the story section usually the last subsection is statistics or statistical in which you describe data presentation and you may state that the data are in or in arithmetic with their confidence further the used in hypothesis testing the name and supplier computer application used significance level p and any in multiple testing as with the correction in which the p level is equal to the quotient of and the number this that compare test and control data at five different times and the hypothesis for more than just one time the p level should be set to to be in line with the ordinary you also should state whether the testing is one sided or two sided whether parametric or non parametric were used and whether you have a power analysis in and qualitative research this section often a more extensive account than customary in tory such extensive include between explanatory chapter p page independent and effect choice measure and choice bivariate or analyses see and this section should be written in the passive voice as what been done is more important than who did it section what you found in logical order tell your story or with in brevity and in the past tense try to mention the most important first and place pivotal early in negative and trivial may be towards the end often recommend that the section paper clinical should begin with an overview test in my opinion such are so unexciting that they should be included under and as men above but follow the journal s style guide that they belong here this section is not the place to discuss but occasionally you must briefly present to clarify to the reader why the experiment was con ducted what the mean and how they lead to the next experiment occasionally you may start the section by to an experiment that the main enquiry the section can be telegraphic concise language often is best remember some have considerable page hence i prefer the concise blood pressure constant fig to the more verbose it can be seen from figure that blood pressure constant in the text do not repeat data already included in cross and tables however you should refer to the data presentation to document the description course experiment and the as between test and control biological significance is just as important as significance so is doubled or halved or linearly or exponentially with time such a description is in order in my opinion it is better to state p together with or tables than in the text section a figure or table that the raw data replicated is more convincing than the presentation single experiment with the ancillary explanation that three replicate gave similar whenever the scientific communication p page variation is large you may be obliged to present the data this way in any case state that you have selected representative not typical as after all you do present the best alternatively you may present a summary provided that you normalize data such as by setting the median or the mean for the control group at but then you must state the absolute value figure such as in a footnote the ranged from to l murphy s supposed law that anything that can go wrong will go wrong but you should have good reason for excluding atypical and the exclusion criteria should be set before project work so you may need to describe the common atypical at the end section discussion section against the backdrop consensus scientific field it also forth the relevance as elsewhere it should be in the past tense but the general should be in the present tense a good rule is to start the discussion with a principal in summary in this way you can interpret the in light main problem that was in the introduction paper what do the mean how do your fit in with the common body knowledge which previous yours and those support your and which deviate from your as above it is essential that you are familiar with the literature field and know who orthodox opinion here you should cite the first most important and not overview this may present a dilemma if the initial publication was qualitatively weak but the next from the same group more fundamental as you must economize on the number in your paper occasionally the meaning may not be obvious there are several to this start with the most plausible hans allegedly said our must be correct our need not be help us to discover important new chapter p page it may be relevant to point to the necessary and sufficient for the you have and to explain why have not found what you have found perhaps the experimental set up the animal model often you must in an unassuming way say what is new in and important about your paper to get it your should be both new and important so that you do not get the response once given by a referee who samuel s remark your manuscript is both good and original but the part that is good is not original and the part that is original is not good honesty occasionally you will need to discuss concerning dis similar phenomena or you might then start with the most important cannot decide what is most important use the order presentation journal layout so you can put on these discussion the final section may contain a few or concluding perhaps with a rough sketch research by the journal style these could be common from the introduction intended to introduce the background of the project excessively long account section discussion in which the author to justify a place in history or show a command literature which may be speculative the discus sion should be actual and not expand beyond them avoid excessive generalization faulty gradation indeed you must point to what is new and import ant and to how the may be generalized and used but do not exaggerate discussion however negative might advantageously be too few with the should not be swept under the rug resist the n to criticize personally preferably discuss their incongruous with a tone as can be seen writing the discussion section is like sailing between scylla and charybdis use common sense here as elsewhere in science it is the best scientific communication p page guide a suitable length for the discussion sect ion is three double spaced point type manuscript tables and in general you have your raw data and you have chosen the audience for your paper first ask data and which data may be by qualitative mention in text might a summary data or with their confidence interval or standard error mean and the number be sufficient data are vital or copious you may choose to present them in tables or some are certainly not in alone such as the electrophoresis or a usual rule for choosing between tables and is use tables whenever exact or comparison with the data is essential use when the relationship between an independent variable x and a dependent variable y principal point as in an event over time in other ease under standing and tables provide more comprehensive documentation you know that many will only read the title and abstract and scan your this will influence your choice or bar or remember that tables and with and principally should be self explanatory ask the average level audience and express terminology and accordingly moreover these graphic must comply with the journal to and in sizing you must take account the journal is printed in one or two column format the and the preparation are usually the first in a manuscript where you may discover for which you must perform more or otherwise collect more data let your imagination run free sketch several and the goal is a maximum in a minimum space without ambiguity or deceitful layout occasionally tables or may be divided in two to promote understanding one approach for is a composite figure of chapter p page two or more above each other with the same x axis in all remember that in a paper often are ill to or and that tables in a paper are always unsuitable for other so as you prepare and tables for a paper make other for or be tables and should be self explanatory so often you must strike a mise between brevity and comprehensiveness in and the should be given under and but occasionally you must include sufficient on to promote understanding which you should avoid as much as possible should be written out in full upon first use or defined in a section in the paper moreover you must define locus centroid uncertainty measure and occasionally measure of spread number analyses and replicate for example with their confidence are shown n replicate in each case a total independent with similar was per formed present data state the level data corresponding to as well as the range data when such information is given in the first fig ure caption or footnote to the first table you often can save space in the rest data presentation by writing see legend to figure for further information when you have finished the tables and check to see whether they are in a uniform manner are the showing the same sort the same in different tables likewise have axes of the same variable been the same in different go carefully through all the with an extra eagle eye on the tables looking for superfluous information are there any non essential data that can be or to figure or table or again ask a capable critical non specialist colleague to go through your illustration material finally check your data presentation material for internal consistency as well as for consistency between it and in the body text will have a poor impression work the you make a contention that is not obvious in the tables and or text and the tables or are contradictory finally the tables and must be in their order in the paper in a margin you may mark the desired location figure here scientific communication p page tables a typical table like this but in all its format should comply with that stated in the to row data field row row footnote a footnote b footnote c the caption for the table should convey its main message say what it avoid vague dull such as the effect of use the to convey more information on table content and interpretation the same sort should be in not in the should be so that comparison is easy for example in adjacent in the table it is convenient to start with the control data or the normal data to the left and up in the table the average reader will absorb the information in the table from left to right and from top to bottom so that order is the most educational see box chapter box good tables note clarity and clear column almost never the same table style in a paper as with graphics such as s of should be simple without too many same under each other in not in avoid a false impression such as by listing more than for example two significant p page data that easily can be calculated from the raw data or monotonic data such as multiple of or may be to or to the section see box be meticulous and uniform with the number see box and with the use how should you choose the number so as to avoid a false impression precision the number is equal to the number known with some degree so my choice is to be by the uncertainty measure or confidence interval i choose two cant for the confidence interval or therefore in text or tables you do not write l for this interval range four significant million presentation to the correct number then is l median confidence inter val n alternatively but a correct example high precision measurement might be as the width confidence interval now only two significant while the mean correctly five significant some go farther than me in contending that whenever data are listed for comparison as in a table they should have no more than two significant this for instance that never have si system should be used as consistently as possible and of should whenever practical be with si micro kilo see box scientific communication do not include that can easily be calculated from other in the table proofread the table against the original draft caption

must be satisfied with at a poster session but the poster session is no subculture and justifiably not manage to interest a session audience in your subject and your the mal discussion can be more thorough and more rewarding than the nervous session that you may endure after giving a paper moreover you can gain and for life regrettably poster sessions are often poorly organized so that you may have to cut down on a lunch break or first meet late in the evening when you are weary your work may then be a poster session may be expedient chapter p page scientific communication for the researcher who must present something to have travel covered however poster sessions can be superb when the audience the opportunity to study the undisturbed by simultaneous sessions and with the particular sector grouped together take time in sketch alternative on letter or a you will have received accurate on and on whether the should be in portrait or landscape orientation think newspaper page set the title problem or purpose description and the final conclusion in large the most common mistake is to overload the poster with information be daring choose a shorter more catchy and title than you would have used on a paper should go through the same simplification process that you would use in taking those paper to and tables should be far simpler than those paper your message must be discernible by a weary watcher without strain therefore you can delete and and just state significant such as with you may also curtail the method description or provide more detailed information in smaller type than used elsewhere on the poster and you can use to provide supplementary for those interested sometimes a small version of the poster can serve as a handout to know the standard they can ask and you get into a discussion the physiological society in for some are thought provoking or the space avail able is limited so your poster should have just one main point all information should be readable at a distance of which that the amount of information is limited have no more than six that together take up no more than poster limit the prose on the poster to a minimum the message poster should be obvious without supplementary verbal and slang should be the order the material should be obvious in addition i have found that a three column poster in the customary portrait orientation is a good pattern the tall title should be at least high at least high and text in the first and last introduction problem description and conclusion at least high are commonplace but

spoken word remains a cornerstone there are daily aplenty as the success or failure and other public people on what they say and how they say it verbal are no less important for in our research and hypotheses for more or less interested indeed the root word lecture is the latin meaning to read unquestionably verbal communication remain vital certainly we know from experience that even the most highly lis often difficulty grasping everything in a lecture we also know that attentiveness during the course lecture as in the attentiveness curve for a typical minute lecture as shown in figure at first glance the high to low swing attentiveness curve may age a lecturer but it is actually a valuable aid to a lecture the of the curve show that a lecturer may convey a message most easily in the first few and towards the end lecture the course curve that there is always room for improvement in p page the goal short chapter on the ure method is to put forth about and advice on being a better lecturer so that you may actually enjoy and not least so that an audience will enjoy listening to you success in preparation preparation and more preparation you must prepare the lecture and you must prepare and your delivery the lecture in advance think two essential first you must start well in advance and secondly you must gauge your audience box chapter of audience fully attentive time min figure attentiveness during a minute lecture box the lecture take time gauge your audience according to type audience level take time to prepare the good lecture is a result maturing process in which both the material to be and the way it is improve with the time taken to prepare p page devote a few to preparation not continuously none time for that but begin well in advance so the material can mature in your subconscious a lecture prepared the evening before is seldom successful the you prepare the lecture the more assured you will be about the message it is to convey the more time you will have to and the more confident you will be delivery indeed even the most skilled might heed a remark to winston want me to speak for two it will take me three want me to speak for thirty it will take me a week to prepare want me to speak for an hour i m ready now gauge your audience many live with the that are by a wealth of by intricate hypotheses on the contrary are happiest when the material is so simple and clearly that they can follow all lecture accordingly as it is vital that we gauge our audience we must consider both the type to be given and the level of the audience first as a lecturer you must be aware type to be given whether it is to be a university course lecture a talk at a review seminar or a own work at an international meeting as the type the way you assemble it a university course lecture or a seminar talk few own data while a presentation at a meeting usually only your own set in the perspective research sector in the level audience you should determine whether they are in your field in many or audience is decisive in the level of detail the amount information given and the amount the the audience the more background information must be included and the more must be on the way a lecture for in your own field may include far more and put forth many more hypotheses than would a lecture for with little background in your research field remember in it is almost impossible to underestimate your audience as a rule we overestimate successful p page lecture content and form the rest chapter on a scientific lecture presentation we in and clinical research are fortunate in that we ally can build our around in a lecture may be used in the introduction in the presentation material in the presentation and not least in the final summary even though ease the structure scientific lecture there are general ground to follow amount of the right amount is one greater usually are built around in the form computer and no more than should be included in a minute lecture the exact number with the complexity material a clue to the right amount can be by read ing the lecture aloud to yourself you should speak at a rate more than a minute so the time you take is a guide to the right amount of material that said it is wise to include leeway by an amount that less time to present than you are as unless you are not too live delivery always longer than reading aloud to yourself see box chapter box match amount of material to time maximum per minute lecture per minute aim for less time than versus journal scientific differ from scientific journal to a journal paper a lecture should place greater emphasis on introductory and background information less emphasis on unless the lecture is on the development methodology and less emphasis on discussion col a usual approach for a minute lecture is in box p page successful and journal to a paper a lecture more introductory and background information shorter description shorter discussion minute lecture minute introduction or background information on on summary and lecture structure start with the and go from the simple to the more complex box the obvious goal is for as many as possible to follow the lecture from its start and that is easiest with the the audience from the start may irritate and discourage so much so that attention is lost for the rest lecture remember the attentiveness curve see the following on the introduction box lecture structure start with the build from the simple to the more complex logical build the lecture around reach on the way repeat essential the logical structure understanding do not jump back and forth between but try to have a sequence do this most easily by building the lecture around computer or with the attentiveness curve in mind it is wise to include p page and on the way this strategy back the who have lost the thread lecture and it easier for all to follow the lecture and remember your it is also wise to repeat essential in the course lecture introduction the introduction is the most important part lecture so work hard on it a good introduction interest and as above most easily your message most audience will follow well in the first few so first awaken attention much been won a may introduce you and your topic but you may do that the start lecture here it is best to be succinct before you launch into the relevant background topic the background should enable the to understand the subsequently data and should link directly to the approach to the problem take time in deliver ing the background the shorter the lecture the greater the proportion that should be devoted to background the approach to the problem should be as precisely and briefly as possible as point by point can point to matter of fact importance or meaning do so see box chapter box introduction vital rouse audience interest start by your topic take time for the background present the approach to the problem precisely briefly point by point above it is beneficial to build around you may use computer or but one rule to all keep it short and simple kiss box p page first few per picture encourage the audience to try to follow what you have to show next as a rule it is better to present a message in a simple figure than in a bulleted list which is the alternative most people more easily understand a graphic figure with than a lecturer who goes through text as can be seen by the impact with the text further a figure more impact than a table compare figure with box successful computer or kiss keep it short and simple few per picture are preferable to text are preferable to tables and are fine but avoid think use large and clear such as or comic sans with upper case and lower case do not write all and computer in landscape

concluding a lecture as in the attentiveness curve often some can be towards the end lecture at this point many may suddenly realize that they have greater lecture sound so here you have a chance to fix that failing by the key as well as their relevance to the initial approach to the problem thereby the wheel come full circle and even those who have been attentive only at the start and the end lecture will have received your message see box the summary and presentation must be short and precise and preferably point by point simple work well here your message is conclude the lecture by sketching the future for your research perhaps with their transfer value to other research general do not forget to list your successful tabular presentation of effect of on effect on synthesis in b medium sac sac m sac m sac m p page manuscript now you have finished the lecture before you start working on delivery you should decide what sort you will use my advice to is to have a manuscript to hand but not to use it it is reassuring to know that the manuscript is readily accessible box chapter box concluding a lecture vital are tie the conclusion to the introduction the wheel goes full circle summary and short point by point simple further list box a manuscript is reassuring in a manuscript start with the whole text highlight or underline the principal write a short version write a catchword manuscript for a good catchword manuscript write only on one side sheet use large preferably marked in various one best to writing a lecture manuscript is to start with the whole text that is everything that you might say in verbal form then highlight or underline the principal before going on to a short version finally compile a catchword manuscript example in box you are free to choose the type up manuscript but i recommend that you use a catchword p page successful manuscript whole text and catchword manuscript manuscript whole text first inviting me to present my at this

lecture room and a lecture preparation as above it is wise to start well in advance box when you have finished a lecture it is time to its delivery the more time you devote to the more confident you will be as a lecturer again thorough preparation is essential just think much and rehearse their p page mental preparation nervousness most people are nervous before they perform be they or it is a natural human reaction however what is vital is that you do not allow nervousness to overpower but rather learn to master it nervousness is marked by accelerated heart rate in the stomach shaky and a dry mouth these are due to an adrenaline level and to a mod degree are a healthy reaction for a lecturer the adrenaline level you the kick you need to do just a bit more but you need to learn to master your nat ural nervousness by a few simple box chapter box nervousness everyone is nervous more or less a higher adrenaline level you an extra useful kick learn to master nervousness be well prepared be positive boast to yourself keep a manuscript at hand but use it only in an emergency the most important and easiest way to combat nervousness is to know that you are well prepared have devoted enough time in preparation your will have lain maturing in your subconscious and you will have sufficient time to rehearse your delivery simple such as these increase confidence and combat nervousness boast to yourself say to you are the one in the lecture hall that your topic best and that you have been to because professional think positive such as it being a joy to tell about and discuss your interesting a manuscript at hand also nervousness worst and you miss the thread presentation just leisurely pick up the manuscript then you can continue by the manuscript or just glance at it and then continue as that certainty should make you confident as long as you have a manuscript to hand you cannot go wrong p page value the delivery lecture cannot be through you gain confidence and combat nervousness rehearse aloud so you are accustomed to hearing your own voice use or as an audience and accept all the feedback they offer time yourself so you know that you have rightly the time to cover your material one good trick is to mark your manuscript at the halfway point and check against it so that you learn to adjust delivery speed on the way familiarize yourself with the lecture room many even the more experienced overlook the importance of being familiar with the lecture locale undoubtedly you have seen delay or lecture sessions because they are unfamiliar with the such as remote or laser embarrassing result and you often see that the lecturer is unnerved so always take time to check such in advance box you then appear more experienced and less nervous and you do not cause unnecessary to a not least this to computer for which the still ate for and meeting alike a small detail turn laser pointer when you are not it to point at a board or screen a laser beam can injure let it dance over the audience as you lecture successful familiarize yourself with the lecture room order the you need check that they work learn how to operate the lighting and the sound system laser pointer a fine aid but learn to use it correctly non verbal communication before you go forth to lecture be aware that the overall impression you give a significant effect on how well the audience your lecture it been said that an audience gains its first impression lecturer within p page and the greater part impression regrettably not on what you have said but rather on non verbal communication hence the so rule box impression you give on your stage presence your eye contact your your appearance your clothes impression comes from your voice that is your pitch intonation and regularity a mere comes from what you say perhaps this is discouraging but it is all the more reason to choose your style carefully chapter box non verbal communication the rule your stage presence eye contact movement appearance clothes voice pitch intonation regularity what you say your message box a lecture i assume a relaxed posture take a deep breath before you begin but do not sigh wait for the audience to quiet down before you start start with a relaxed informal tone gain eye contact with the those in the back let your glance wander over the audience but do not focus on a single victim the delivery itself you have prepared a lecture in all possible ways you know the lecture room and its so you now are ready to deliver the lecture again there are small that can improve a lecture both for you and for your audience box often a relaxed posture within reasonable seem at ease your audience may take the cue and the atmosphere will be friendly take a few deep before you start your delivery in a relaxed informal tone this you to relax and any nervousness and you gain control voice p page it is best to wait for the audience to quieten down before you start distracted give you the lecturer an uninspiring start and as above it is best that all are attentive from the beginning consciously keep eye contact with the audience lighting does not blind let your gaze wander over the audience so that you have at everyone in the course lecture be sure not to choose a victim a single person to whom you seem to lecture refer to a manuscript wish but do not read your lecture from it that is easiest have prepared a catchword manuscript rapid speech is hard to understand so talk at no more than per minute as you undoubtedly know from experience it is easier to follow a lecture when the lecturer intonation key and overall to draw the audience along throughout the lecture an audience will be more lecturer and enthusiastic remember that the lecturer is the salesperson for the message lecture again there is a fine line an audience will be by a lecturer who is certain but certainty becomes arrogance box successful a lecture have a manuscript do not read it directly maximum of per minute speak loudly and clearly vary intonation take and underscore essential do not talk with your back to the audience point at the board or screen only when necessary smile show enthusiasm be certain but not arrogant sufficient time for is also well is art and that art may be problematical at international where it may be difficult to understand the politeness is the solution there is nothing wrong with that a question be repeated p page another check is for you the lecturer to repeat the question in your own as you have understood it thereafter answer keeping in mind that the question and your answer go to the entire audience not just to the listener who avoid arrogance in an answer such as i believe i covered that in the lecture the questioner feel stupid and exposed to contempt but in fact you may be responsible for the person not what you said instead you might say sorry that i t make that sufficiently clear but the in this way you lower the threshold for to pose on the whole this when you are as it otherwise does in between people try to be as positive polite and humble as you can but here the comparison with ordinary conversation because in the lecture you are trying to sell a message you must be completely honest and informative in your and hypotheses but it is also essential that you try to appear certain in your presentation it is always easier to convince an audience message is confidently and well these must be learned and the only way to learn is to prepare well when to lecture and then good luck further reading a american speaker your

research beyond the level training continued success in research for junior as well as senior at and a constant intense effort to acquire research writing successful grant is as essential to scientific success as good testing them by experimentation and in among these for many grant writing is like a dark cloud over a bright landscape necessary but stressful and unpleasant one reason for the stress associated with writing for to sup port work that is but not yet done is that innovative research cannot be really only the general for it to happen can be in some ways we deceive ourselves when we believe that the process p page discovery at least in basic research can be to the extent by many that call for to define and predict a for therefore writing that conform to the ed frequently making that know cannot be kept in the area basic research this necessary to obtain is at odds with the open and honest most talented generating stress a second reason why grant writing can be stressful is that the review grant by scientific peer or an evaluation and intuitive about the unknown and how it should be in a proposal the investigator forth personal and hypotheses to be tested by future and must expose his or her scientific soul so to speak to convince that the put forth are sufficiently important and innovative to warrant investment in many a rejection proposal is tantamount to a rejection personal that can shatter an tor s confidence as a scientist much more forcefully than does a rejection notice for a paper to a professional journal rejection script to a disagreement between its author s and reviewer s or tor s about experimental evidence and how it is usually such can be overcome by improving the evidence and the paper or by the manuscript to another journal a grant application usually may be revised and although this the likelihood funded it does not guarantee that will be see below finally most research include indirect that pay for the institutional the infrastructure space electricity water gas that research possible hence there is pressure on to obtain for that are more financial than scientific coupled with a continuous stream of for or from in

increasingly many link the research space to to the amount that they generate chapter p page through the result is institutional pressure on to shift their focus from doing innovative science to large that said it is possible to structure the process writing so it becomes part creative aspect discovery for many grant this may be difficult but for smaller investigator grant we believe that a few

an investigator r grant are in box are to keep these criteria in mind guide to grant p page chapter box review criteria for investigator r significance does the study address an important problem approach are the conceptual or clinical framework design and analyses adequately we well reasoned and appropriate to the project innovation is the project original and innovative are the appropriately trained and well to carry out the work environment does the scientific environment contribute to the prob ability in but there is no direct numerical relationship between the criteria and the overall rating an application need not score high in all to be given a high priority score thus the final rating is an assessment overall merit grant however the most reliable route to a high fundable score is to take all the criteria into account in writing an application in the eu system there is a threshold score and a typical value might be for the or for impact the proposal will be considered further only on such criteria are higher than the preset see section obviously an applicant should identify and address any threshold before a proposal the r type grant is the original historically

collaboration and the availability and by the s international science liaison office za international for in australia the australian research council arc arc t for international collaboration and network building by research international and internationally for international in clinical is available in where the involved are each eligible for by the administration or canadian for health research in the nordic should note that in a new fund ing agency asp was established to promote seamless research across the particularly in scientific in which they already have leading so far rather limited at its disposal thus the from this agency should be as seed money or add on meant to facilitate collaboration between nordic research already three nordic through its molecular medicine finally several devote significant funds to international research for example the trust international research in and for tropical and clinical research in and international and this support is available through project and and other targeted in the the bill melinda foundation is as one world s most powerful with health pro as a major focus the foundation research and clinical in several priority disease child health malaria tuberculosis and vaccine preventable it also will consider for support that is likely to achieve fundamental in three science and to make against in develop ing that can serve as for accurate and affordable diagnostic and application in genetics and molecular biology to global health guide to grant p page the european union s seventh framework the eu is intended to promote international collaboration across legally it is intended to boost the competitiveness industry and to tackle related to the pursuit framework participation with community is avail able to in eu that are for eu membership and depending on the particular other some is available for elsewhere provided that their participation in a project is as essential for its starting in with the seventh framework the european research council will evolve into a body similar to the in the consequently a greater share research and development r d is now channelled through the of the european research area era hence young are to relate to the eu and era it is the experience that the a member strong european network justify the time it to run the network and to report the the eu s was in and the previous in of time horizon and total budget in most research relevant to health are in the thematic area health budget billion with other in the food billion environment billion information and communication billion and billion another is the people i e training and established plus international often known as the marie curie in the budget allocation is about billion it is the main objective health research area to help to improve the health s by the knowledge and its use to overcome major health with the potential to reduce the high related to the treatment and care among other r d and validation are see box chapter p page many new large or small are to be in two short proposal first by a longer submission for those in stage eu within the will be according to various criteria depending on type the evaluation criteria for collaborative are listed in box prospective should check the accessible via the portal at europa eu and especially the europa eu index call id that important information on the application and evaluation process guide to grant box and of the eu research the focus on objective driven research and development i e clearly defined scientific and technological aiming at cant in the established state art research often are in their composition are put together with an eye on how the knowledge advanced by them will be used and therefore include such as ing to the protection and dissemination to pro mote the exploitation and when relevant take up include training and other key staff research man and potential knowledge produced within the project there is a focus on project management box evaluation criteria applicable to collaborative project for s t quality scientific and or technological excellence soundness and quality objective progress beyond the state of the art quality and effectiveness s t methodology and associated work plan p page summary and perspective and other support are available to postdoctoral and in most for training and research in knowing as much as possible about where to apply and how to write a good application are crucial process by which a grant can be successfully however in a
