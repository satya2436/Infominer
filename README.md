<h2>Inspiration:</h2>
<li>Biomedical ontologies are becoming increasingly popular in the computational biology community as the focus of biology has started to shift from mapping genomes to analyzing the vast amount of information resulting from functional genomics research. In fact, biomedical ontologies play a central role in integrating the information about various model organisms, acquired under different conditions and stored in heterogeneous databases. </li>

<h2>Problem description:</h2>
<li>Biomedical ontology research encompasses a variety of entities from dictionaries of names for biological products, to controlled vocabularies, to principled knowledge structures and processes i.e., acquisition of ontological relations, integration of heterogeneous databases, use of ontologies for reasoning about biological knowledge. Â </li>

<h2>Solution:</h2>
<li>The purpose of biomedical Ontology is to collect the names of entities (i.e., substances, qualities and processes) employed in the biomedical domain, the purpose of biomedical ontology is to study classes of entities in reality which are of biomedical significance, ontology is also concerned with the principled definition of biological classes and the relations among them.</li>


<h2>Working progress:</h2>
<li> User need to use biomedical book for the ontology Generation</li>
<li>The model will extract information from the book and go through a series of NLP process.</li>
<li>At the end of successfull completion of all the operations it will generate a owl(Web Ontology Language file) containing the class , entities and relationship among them.</li>


<h2>Advantage:</h2>
<li>By having the essential relationships between concepts built into them, they enable automated reasoning about data.</li>
<li>Provides more coherent and easy navigation as users move from one concept to another in the ontology structure.</li>
<li>Play a central role in integrating the information about various model organisms, acquired under different conditions and stored in heterogeneous databases.</li>

<h2>Future Scope:</h2>
<li>Looking to expand the project for the other domain also.</li>


<h2>Limitations:</h2>
<li>Infominer will work perfectly if the pdf document is well formatted and less of image and other symbol inserted.</li>
